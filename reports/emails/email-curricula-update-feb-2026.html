<p class="subject"><strong>Subject:</strong> Quarex Update &mdash; Curricula, New Books, and the Solo Builder Model</p>
<hr>

<p>One of the books in the Quarex is called <em>AI as a Force Multiplier for Knowledge Work</em>. Its eighth chapter &mdash; <a href="https://quarex.org/libraries/pr/practical-skills/digital-and-professional-skills/ai-as-a-force-multiplier/one-person-many-outputs-the-solo-builder-model">One Person, Many Outputs: The Solo Builder Model</a> &mdash; describes what becomes possible when one person with AI can produce what previously required a team. That chapter is also a description of how the Quarex itself is built. Every book, every syllabus, every index in this system is the product of one person directing AI as an instrument &mdash; making strategic decisions about structure, sequence, and scope while the AI handles volume execution.</p>

<h2>The New quarex.org Homepage</h2>

<p>The front page of <a href="https://quarex.org">quarex.org</a> has been redesigned as a navigation hub for the entire ecosystem. It now links directly to Knowable Online University, the full library of 647 books, Public Studies curricula, the 2026 Elections site, search, a library tree index, and creator tools. The idea is that quarex.org is the launchpad &mdash; everything in the ecosystem is reachable from one page.</p>

<h2>Why Curricula</h2>

<p>The Quarex now contains 647 books organized across seven library types. That's a lot of material, and the question became: how do people find their way in?</p>

<p>Curricula solve two problems at once. First, they give learners a guided path through existing books &mdash; a curated sequence that makes the argument for how to understand a field. Instead of browsing shelves, you follow a syllabus.</p>

<p>Second, curricula serve as a blueprint for building. When you lay out a discipline &mdash; say, 18 courses on media literacy &mdash; you can immediately see which books already exist and which need to be created. The curriculum becomes a production guide. Important gaps in coverage surface naturally, and new books can be written to fill them. Several of the books in these curricula were built specifically because the syllabus revealed they were missing.</p>

<h2>Three New Curricula</h2>

<p>All three are live now on <a href="https://publicstudies.org">publicstudies.org</a> as part of the School of Public Studies at <a href="https://knowableonline.org">Knowable Online University</a>:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://publicstudies.org/AIStudiesSyllabus.html">AI Studies</a></strong> &mdash; 19 courses, 225 chapters, 1,527 topics. Understanding artificial intelligence as a citizen, worker, and voter. Covers foundations of AI, neural networks and LLMs, real-world applications, risks and governance, AI policy, career adaptation, and practical AI skills.</li>

    <li><strong><a href="https://publicstudies.org/MediaStudiesSyllabus.html">Media &amp; Information Studies</a></strong> &mdash; 18 courses, 263 chapters, 1,632 topics. How information works, who controls it, and how to navigate it. Covers critical thinking, media theory, misinformation, political manipulation, technology platforms, concentrated power, and practical fact-checking skills.</li>

    <li><strong><a href="https://publicstudies.org/VisualArtsSyllabus.html">Visual Arts</a></strong> &mdash; 11 courses, 110 chapters, 672 topics.
