<h1>Quarex Update: AI, Navigation, and Curricula</h1>

<p>Bruce, Carol &mdash;</p>

<p>Three updates this week that I think you'll find interesting.</p>

<h2>Switched from Gemini to Claude</h2>

<p>The "Ask Quarex" feature now runs on Claude Sonnet 4.5 instead of Google's Gemini. Here's why:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Better reasoning</strong> &mdash; Claude handles nuanced political and historical questions more carefully. It doesn't oversimplify or dodge complexity.</li>
    <li><strong>More consistent tone</strong> &mdash; Gemini sometimes felt like it was hedging or being overly cautious. Claude gives direct answers while still being balanced.</li>
    <li><strong>Live web search</strong> &mdash; Claude can now search the web in real-time, so when you ask about current events, you get today's news, not six-month-old training data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try it: <a href="https://quarex.org/ask/">Ask Quarex</a></p>

<p>The response quality difference is noticeable. Ask it something about the 2026 elections or current policy debates and you'll see what I mean.</p>

<h2>New Visual Navigation</h2>

<p>This one's fun. I built two interactive maps that let you see the entire Quarex structure at a glance.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Library Navigator</strong> &mdash; Shows all 825 books organized by library type, library, and shelf. Zoom in, pan around, click any node to jump directly there.</p>
<p><a href="https://quarex.org/libraries/navigator.html">Try the Library Navigator &rarr;</a></p>
</div>

<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Ecosystem Navigator</strong> &mdash; Shows how all the Quarex sites connect: the main library, Public Studies, Knowable Online, the Election sites, and the Blog.</p>
<p><a href="https://quarex.org/ecosystem.html">Try the Ecosystem Navigator &rarr;</a></p>
</div>

<p>The problem with 825 books is discoverability. These maps solve that &mdash; you can see everything in one view and get anywhere with a single click.</p>

<h2>Public Studies Curricula</h2>

<p>Public Studies now has 21 structured curricula across 8 schools. Each curriculum pulls from Quarex books and organizes them into a learning path.</p>

<p>Some highlights:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Hispanic Studies</strong> &mdash; 6 curricula covering culture, politics, identity, and history (available in English and Spanish)</li>
    <li><strong>Women's Studies</strong> &mdash; Feminism, reproductive rights, workplace equality, global perspectives</li>
    <li><strong>Black Studies</strong> &mdash; From the Atlantic slave trade through contemporary activism</li>
    <li><strong>Media Studies</strong> &mdash; Propaganda, misinformation, media literacy</li>
    <li><strong>AI Studies</strong> &mdash; Foundations, ethics, real-world applications</li>
    <li><strong>Labor Studies</strong> &mdash; Union history, gig economy, workplace rights</li>
</ul>

<p>The full list: <a href="https://publicstudies.org">publicstudies.org</a></p>

<p>Each curriculum is free, no login required. Just structured learning paths through the material.</p>

<h2>The Big Picture</h2>

<p>Quarex keeps growing: 825 books, 5,308 chapters, six connected sites. The visual navigation makes it all accessible. The Claude integration makes it conversational. And the curricula make it educational.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have questions or want a walkthrough of anything.</p>
