        <h1>Quarex Outreach Email Sequences — Revised</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Revised from Momentum Marketing originals. Three segments, three emails each. Each sequence escalates: <strong>hook &rarr; credibility &rarr; urgency</strong>. All numbers are real and verifiable.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Note to Paige:</strong> These revisions add real platform numbers, specific examples, and escalation across the three-email arc. Links still point to researchyourballot.org routes — update when portal routing is confirmed. The broader Quarex ecosystem is introduced in Email 2 of each sequence to expand the value proposition beyond ballot research.

        <h3>Email 1 &mdash; The Hook</h3>
        <div class="subject">Subject: You Have 37 Races on Your Ballot. You Recognize Maybe 3.</div>
        <div class="email-body">
            <p>Hi [First Name],</p>

            <p>Remember George Santos? He got elected because nobody could easily research who he actually was. No central source. No structured answers. Just campaign websites and whatever Google surfaced first.</p>

            <p>That problem hasn't been fixed. It's gotten worse.</p>

            <p>Research Your Ballot was built for exactly this. Type your zip code. See every race on your ballot. Click into any candidate and get structured, sourced answers to questions like:</p>

            <p>
                &bull; What does this person actually support?<br>
                &bull; Who funds them?<br>
                &bull; What are the tradeoffs of their positions?
            </p>

            <p>No ads. No tracking. No accounts. No cookies. You don't even need to type your name.</p>

            <p class="cta"><a href="https://researchyourballot.org/VoterRoute">See what's on your ballot &rarr;</a></p>

            <p>Takes about 10 minutes. You'll know more than 95% of voters in your district.</p>

        <h3>Email 2 &mdash; The Credibility</h3>
        <div class="subject">Subject: 822 Books. Zero Opinions.</div>
        <div class="email-body">
            <p>Hi [First Name],</p>

            <p>Research Your Ballot isn't a startup with a landing page and a promise. It sits on top of Quarex &mdash; a research library with 822 books, 5,274 chapters, and 39,787 searchable topics covering politics, economics, science, health, and civil rights.</p>

            <p>Every candidate profile draws from that library. Every claim is sourced. Every source is visible.</p>

            <p>There's also an AI research assistant that answers questions using the library as its source &mdash; not the open internet. Ask it anything about a candidate, a policy, or an issue, and it pulls from structured, verified material.</p>

            <p>The entire platform is free. No paywall. No premium tier. No data harvesting.</p>

            <p>Why? Because the person who built it believes informed voters shouldn't need a subscription to find the truth.</p>

        <div class="email-body">
            <p>Hi [First Name],</p>

            <p>Candidates are already filing. Primaries are being scheduled. By the time most voters start paying attention, the field will be set and the narratives will be locked in.</p>

            <p>This is the window where research actually matters &mdash; before the attack ads, before the endorsements, before the vibes take over.</p>

            <p>Research Your Ballot gives you:</p>

            <p>
                &bull; Every federal race in your district, by zip code<br>
                &bull; Structured candidate profiles with sourced positions<br>
                &bull; AI-powered research you can ask follow-up questions<br>
                &bull; Zero tracking, zero accounts, zero cost
            </p>

            <p>10 minutes now saves you from guessing in November.</p>

            <p>Hi [First Name],</p>

            <p>You know the assignment. "Research a candidate running in your district."</p>

            <p>You know what happens next. Wikipedia. TikTok. A campaign website. Maybe a Reddit thread. One student cites a meme as a source. Another one triggers a parent email because the article they found had a partisan headline.</p>

            <p>That's not civic literacy. That's a liability.</p>

            <p>Research Your Ballot gives students a structured starting point: real candidates, real races, sourced answers, guided inquiry. No ads, no tracking, no accounts.</p>

            <p>It was built nonpartisan by design &mdash; not as a marketing claim, but as an architecture decision. There are no opinion pieces, no editorials, no endorsements anywhere in the system.</p>

        <div class="email-body">
            <p>Hi [First Name],</p>

            <p>Research Your Ballot is part of a larger platform called Quarex. Here's what's behind it:</p>

            <p>
                &bull; <strong>822 books</strong> across politics, science, economics, civil rights, and history<br>
                &bull; <strong>5,274 chapters</strong> of structured, sourced content<br>
                &bull; <strong>21 curricula</strong> organized into 8 schools through Public Studies (publicstudies.org)<br>
                &bull; An <strong>AI research assistant</strong> that answers questions from the library, not the open internet<br>
                &bull; <strong>Quarex Research</strong> &mdash; a tool that generates downloadable research briefs on any topic
            </p>

            <p>Every piece of content shows its sources. Students can evaluate the sourcing as part of the assignment &mdash; that's a media literacy lesson built into the tool itself.</p>

            <p>The curricula at Public Studies cover everything from Constitutional Law to Climate Science to Media Literacy. They're structured for self-directed learning, which means they work for homework, independent study, or classroom discussion.</p>

            <p>Everything is free. No school purchase order required. No IT department approval. No student data collected.</p>

        <div class="email-body">
            <p>Hi [First Name],</p>

            <p>Here's a lesson plan that works right now:</p>

            <p>
                1. Students enter their zip code and identify the races on their ballot (5 min)<br>
                2. Each student picks a candidate and reads the structured profile (10 min)<br>
                3. Students identify one claim, trace it to its source, and evaluate the source (10 min)<br>
                4. Class discussion: What surprised you? What couldn't you find? (5 min)
            </p>

            <p>No prep required on your end beyond opening the link. The content is structured, the sources are visible, and there is nothing in the system that takes a partisan position.</p>

            <p>If a parent asks where the information came from, every answer has a citation. If an administrator asks about bias, the platform has no editorial voice, no opinion section, and no ads.</p>

            <p>The 2026 elections are the next real-world civics laboratory your students will experience. This gives them tools to engage with it responsibly.</p>

        <div class="email-body">
            <p>Hi [First Name],</p>

            <p>If you run a library, a nonprofit, or a civic engagement program, you've faced this dilemma: you want to help people research candidates, but every tool you evaluate has a catch.</p>

            <p>Hidden tracking. Subtle editorial slant. Data collection behind a login wall. Sponsored content mixed in with research.</p>

            <p>Any one of those is enough to make you hesitate. And if you're the one recommending the tool, the risk lands on you.</p>

            <p>Research Your Ballot was built differently:</p>

            <p>
                &bull; No accounts. No logins. No cookies.<br>
                &bull; No ads. No sponsored content. No editorial voice.<br>
                &bull; Every answer shows its source.<br>
                &bull; Zero user data is collected. There's nothing to breach because nothing is stored.
            </p>

            <p>This isn't a privacy policy claim. It's the actual architecture. There is no database of users.</p>

        <div class="email-body">
            <p>Hi [First Name],</p>

            <p>Research Your Ballot isn't a standalone app. It's the front door to Quarex &mdash; a free, open research library built to make sourced information accessible to everyone.</p>

            <p>The numbers as of today:</p>

            <p>
                &bull; <strong>822 books</strong> covering politics, science, economics, health, civil rights, history, and technology<br>
                &bull; <strong>5,274 chapters</strong> of structured, cited content<br>
                &bull; <strong>39,787 searchable topics</strong><br>
                &bull; An <strong>AI research tool</strong> that generates briefs from the library &mdash; not from the open internet<br>
                &bull; <strong>Candidate profiles</strong> for every federal race in the 2026 cycle
            </p>

            <p>The entire ecosystem runs across four sites: quarex.org (the library), election2026.net (election coverage), publicstudies.org (structured curricula), and knowableonline.org (self-directed learning).</p>

            <p>All free. All source-transparent. All built by one person who got tired of watching misinformation win.</p>

            <p>Here's what deployment looks like:</p>

            <p>
                1. You visit the tool and verify it meets your neutrality standards<br>
                2. You add a link to your website, your newsletter, or your resource guide<br>
                3. Your community members click it, enter their zip code, and start researching
            </p>

            <p>That's it. No integration. No API. No vendor agreement. No IT ticket. No budget line item.</p>

            <p>You can confidently tell your board, your patrons, or your community:</p>

            <p>
                <em>"We provide nonpartisan voter education. It's free. It's private. It shows its sources. We've reviewed it."</em>
            </p>

            <p>No disclaimers. No hesitation.</p>

            <p>The 2026 elections are coming. Your community will need research tools they can trust. This one is ready now.</p>
