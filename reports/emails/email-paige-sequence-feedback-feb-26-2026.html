        <p>Paige &mdash;</p>

        <p>This is excellent feedback. I agree with all of your specific language calls. Go ahead and make these revisions on your end since you&rsquo;re the one sending. A few notes as you work through them:</p>

        <p><strong>Segment 1</strong> &mdash; Santos hook stays, trim after it to get to the CTA faster. The &ldquo;95% of voters&rdquo; swap and the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; to &ldquo;sourced civic information&rdquo; change are both right. Agree on all three.</p>

        <p><strong>Segment 2</strong> &mdash; Your compliance-neutral reframe on the IT line is smart. Educators forwarding this to administrators don&rsquo;t want to look like they&rsquo;re bypassing procurement. Make that change.</p>

        <p><strong>Segment 3</strong> &mdash; The data privacy flag is the most important note in your entire response. The site does use aggregate analytics (Google Analytics), so &ldquo;zero user data collected&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t technically accurate. Your version &mdash; &ldquo;No accounts. No logins. No user profiles. No behavioral tracking.&rdquo; &mdash; is precise and defensible. Use that.</p>

        <p>On the &ldquo;misinformation win&rdquo; line &mdash; agreed, reframe as builder not fighter for institutional audiences.</p>

        <p><strong>One thought on the 20% trim:</strong> I&rsquo;d do it selectively rather than across the board. Tighten after the Santos hook, yes. But the credibility and urgency emails need their evidence to land &mdash; each email in the sequence has a specific job.</p>

        <p>Looking forward to reviewing the Apollo list when it&rsquo;s ready. Friday morning works for a call if today doesn&rsquo;t line up.</p>
