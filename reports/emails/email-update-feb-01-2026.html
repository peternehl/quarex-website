<h1>Quarex Update: Two New Sites Join the Platform</h1>

<p>Quarex started as one site &mdash; a curiosity engine built from structured questions and contextual discovery. This week it became a family of four, each one designed around a different audience and a different way in.</p>

<h2>PublicStudies.org &mdash; Curated Curricula</h2>

<p>The idea behind PublicStudies is simple: take the books already inside Quarex and arrange them into reading paths that follow the structure of a real university discipline.</p>

<p>A curriculum on PublicStudies doesn't duplicate content. It points to it. Each course is a link into a specific Quarex book, and each book lives on its shelf alongside related books that provide natural context. The curriculum gives you the sequence; Quarex gives you the depth.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Live now:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Women's Studies</strong> &mdash; 3 courses including feminist theory, women's rights history, and Eleanor Roosevelt's biography</li>
    <li><strong>Black Studies</strong> &mdash; 2 courses covering the history of racism in the Americas and the Civil Rights Movement</li>
    <li><strong>Ethnic Studies</strong> &mdash; 1 course on the history of racism in the Americas</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming soon: Labor Studies, Estudios Latinos, and Estudios de la Mujer.</p>
</div>

<p>Notice that the same book can appear in multiple curricula. <em>A History of Racism in the Americas</em> shows up in both Black Studies and Ethnic Studies, because it's relevant to both. The book doesn't move. The curricula are pointers, not containers.</p>

<p>This is the same model a university uses: one textbook, many syllabi. The difference is that here, the textbook is a living Quarex book that connects to every other book on its shelf.</p>

<h2>QuarexProject.org &mdash; The Marketing Hub</h2>

<p>As Quarex grows, it becomes harder to explain what the platform is in a single conversation. QuarexProject.org exists to solve that problem.</p>

<p>It's a brand and marketing site &mdash; not for end users, but for people who need to understand what Quarex is, how it works, and why it matters. Potential partners, marketers, educators, journalists, and anyone evaluating the platform can find what they need in one place.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>What's there now:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Brand identity, voice, and design principles</li>
    <li>The Election 2026 marketing brief with target audience data</li>
    <li>Examples of past email campaigns</li>
    <li>Competitive landscape analysis</li>
    <li>Links to all live Quarex properties</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>The Quarex Ecosystem</h2>

<p>Here's where everything lives now:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="site-label">quarex.org</span> &mdash; The engine. 629 books, 3,031 chapters, and the full question-and-context system.</li>
    <li><span class="site-label">election2026.net</span> &mdash; The voter site. Zip code lookup for your candidates, with every race covered.</li>
    <li><span class="site-label">publicstudies.org</span> &mdash; The curriculum site. Bespoke reading paths built from Quarex content.</li>
    <li><span class="site-label">quarexproject.org</span> &mdash; The marketing site. Brand, materials, and strategy for partners and collaborators.</li>
</ul>

<p>Four sites, one knowledge base. Every question on every site leads back to the same structured library system &mdash; the same books, the same shelves, the same context engine. The only thing that changes is which door you walk through.</p>

<p>As always, paste any question into your preferred AI for instant research.</p>
