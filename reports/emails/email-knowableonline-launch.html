<h1>Introducing Knowable Online University</h1>

<p>When we started Quarex, it was one site with one idea: structure knowledge around questions, not answers. Then came election2026.net for voters, publicstudies.org for curricula, and quarexproject.org for partners. Each site did something different, but they all drew from the same engine.</p>

<p>The question that kept coming up was: what holds all of this together? What's the frame?</p>

<p>The answer is now live at <a href="https://knowableonline.org">knowableonline.org</a>.</p>

<h2>What It Is</h2>

<p>Knowable Online University is the institutional layer above Quarex. It provides the structure that makes the whole system navigable: Schools, Programs, Syllabi, and Courses &mdash; all pointing into the Quarex knowledge engine underneath.</p>

<p>If Quarex is the engine, Knowable Online is the frame. It doesn't replace anything. It organizes what already exists into something a university, a library, or a school district can point to and say: <em>start here</em>.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>Three Schools:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>School of Public Studies</strong> &mdash; Curricula for social, political, and cultural issues. Women's Studies is live (15 courses, 215 chapters). Black Studies is in development.</li>
    <li><strong>School of Political Systems</strong> &mdash; Nonpartisan civic research. All 435 House seats, 33 Senate races, 36 governors.</li>
    <li><strong>School of Knowledge Systems</strong> &mdash; The meta-school. How Quarex itself works, explained through six new explainer pages.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>The Explainer Pages</h2>

<p>The School of Knowledge Systems now has six static pages that explain how Quarex works, using real examples from the system. These exist partly for new users and partly so that search engines and AI models can discover and understand the platform.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://knowableonline.org/what-is-quarex.html">What is Quarex?</a> &mdash; The overview</li>
    <li><a href="https://knowableonline.org/question-driven-architecture.html">Question-Driven Architecture</a> &mdash; How chapters and questions work, with a real chapter from Sojourner Truth</li>
    <li><a href="https://knowableonline.org/what-is-a-quarex-book.html">What is a Quarex Book?</a> &mdash; The full structure of the Sojourner Truth biography (8 chapters, 40 questions)</li>
    <li><a href="https://knowableonline.org/libraries-shelves-and-books.html">Libraries, Shelves &amp; Books</a> &mdash; How the hierarchy works, from library type to individual book</li>
    <li><a href="https://knowableonline.org/what-is-a-syllabus.html">What is a Syllabus?</a> &mdash; How books become curricula, with the Women's Studies syllabus as example</li>
    <li><a href="https://knowableonline.org/nonpartisan-design.html">Nonpartisan Design</a> &mdash; The tag vocabulary, the 4-tag rule, and why questions are structurally neutral</li>
</ul>

<p>Each page embeds actual Quarex data &mdash; real books, real tags, real questions. Nothing is fabricated for illustration.</p>

<h2>The Ecosystem</h2>

<p>Here's where everything lives now:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="site-label">knowableonline.org</span> &mdash; The university frame. Schools, programs, and the explainer pages.</li>
    <li><span class="site-label">quarex.org</span> &mdash; The engine. 641 books, 3,205 chapters, 328 tags across 7 library types.</li>
    <li><span class="site-label">election2026.net</span> &mdash; The voter site. Every federal race in all 50 states.</li>
    <li><span class="site-label">publicstudies.org</span> &mdash; The curriculum site. Structured reading paths built from Quarex books.</li>
    <li><span class="site-label">quarexproject.org</span> &mdash; The marketing site. Brand, strategy, and materials for partners.</li>
</ul>

<p>Five sites, one knowledge base. The door you walk through depends on who you are and what you need. The knowledge behind every door is the same.</p>

<p>As always, either use the <a href="https://quarex.org">Quarex curiosity engine</a> or paste any topic into your preferred AI for instant research.</p>
