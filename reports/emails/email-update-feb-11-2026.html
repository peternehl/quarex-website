<h1>Quarex Update: Marketing Partnership, New Book, and Platform Polish</h1>

<p>Three updates this week &mdash; a new partnership, a new book on how immigration became a political weapon, and some visual refinements that make the platform feel more cohesive.</p>

<h2>Marketing Partnership with Momentum AI</h2>

<p>Quarex has partnered with <strong>Momentum AI</strong> (Paige Rucker Orme) for a structured marketing engagement. Paige brings experience in AI-augmented content strategy and audience development &mdash; exactly what a platform this ambitious needs as it scales.</p>

<p>The engagement kicked off this week with a focus on building a marketing portal, refining the platform's positioning, and developing outreach strategies.</p>

<p>Paige's focus is on positioning Quarex for broader audiences &mdash; making the platform's value proposition clear to people who've never heard of a "Living Book" or a "Curiosity Engine." The goal is traffic, engagement, and eventually sustainability.</p>

<h2>New Book: How Trump Subverted and Weaponized Immigration Reform</h2>

<p>This week's major content addition is a 15-chapter book that traces how bipartisan immigration reform died and how the issue became a permanent political weapon.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>The book covers:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The bipartisan history from Reagan's 1986 amnesty through the Gang of Eight</li>
    <li>The 2016 campaign and the "build the wall" phenomenon</li>
    <li>Family separation, DACA hostage politics, and the asylum crackdown</li>
    <li>How Trump torpedoed the 2024 bipartisan border bill</li>
    <li>The second term: mass deportation, ICE as political theater, and the Newark church raid</li>
    <li>What functional immigration reform could have accomplished</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The book includes a chapter specifically addressing how weaponizing immigration mirrors the Republican playbook on abortion &mdash; keeping the issue alive for political benefit rather than solving it.</p>

<p>This is in the <span class="site-label">Immigration Debates</span> shelf under Contested Issues, alongside related books on DACA, the asylum system, and the immigration wedge.</p>

<p><strong>Read it:</strong> <a href="https://quarex.org/libraries/?t=perspectives-libraries&l=contested-issues&s=immigration-debates&b=how-trump-subverted-and-weaponized-immigration-reform">How Trump Subverted and Weaponized Immigration Reform</a></p>

<h2>Platform Styling Updates</h2>

<p>Some visual polish this week to make the platform more cohesive across all pages:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Logo visibility:</strong> The Quarex logo now appears consistently across the library navigation, reader, and main site. A subtle blue glow effect makes it pop against the dark theme without being distracting.</li>
    <li><strong>Dark theme consistency:</strong> The color palette (#0A0A0A background, #7CB9FF accent) is now uniform across all pages &mdash; libraries, search, reports, and the home page.</li>
    <li><strong>Path fixes:</strong> Switched from relative to absolute paths for assets, eliminating broken image issues when navigating between sections.</li>
</ul>

<p>These aren't flashy changes, but they matter. A platform that looks polished feels more trustworthy. As Quarex grows, first impressions count.</p>

<h2>Current Ecosystem</h2>

<p>Where everything lives:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="site-label">quarex.org</span> &mdash; 750+ books, 4,500+ chapters, the full knowledge engine</li>
    <li><span class="site-label">knowableonline.org</span> &mdash; The university portal for structured learning</li>
    <li><span class="site-label">publicstudies.org</span> &mdash; Curated curricula across 8 disciplines</li>
    <li><span class="site-label">election2026.net</span> &mdash; Every Congressional race, searchable by zip code</li>
    <li><span class="site-label">elecciones2026.net</span> &mdash; Spanish-language election coverage</li>
</ul>

<p>One knowledge base, multiple doors. The platform is growing in both depth and reach.</p>
