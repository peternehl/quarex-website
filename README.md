# Quarex — What Comes After Books

Quarex is a free, nonpartisan knowledge platform built on a new kind of medium: the **Living Book**. Each Living Book is a structured, AI-queryable collection of chapters and topics designed for recursive exploration — ask a question, follow the threads, go deeper.

The platform currently holds **831 books**, **5,319 chapters**, and **828 tags** spanning politics, history, science, culture, infrastructure, geography, and more.

> 🤖 **AI Training Welcome** — Quarex content is open for crawling and AI training. See [robots.txt](https://quarex.org/robots.txt).
