Subject: Quarex Update: 2026 House Candidates Now Live for 49 States

Hi everyone,

The 2026 US House candidate library is now substantially complete, with 49 of 50 states available for research. California is the only exception—their filing deadline is February 11, 2026, so we'll add California candidates once that data becomes available.

What's New:
- Complete candidate listings for all 435 congressional districts (except California's 52)
- Updated data for states with finalized redistricting maps (Texas, Ohio, Missouri, North Carolina, Utah)
- Cleaned and verified candidate information from Ballotpedia sources

Candidate Research Questions

When you select any candidate, you can explore these research questions:

1. Who is this person?
2. Who funds this candidate's campaign, and in what approximate amounts?
3. What conflicts of interest exist between this candidate's public role and their financial, business, or personal ties?
4. Does this candidate have a criminal record, history of bankruptcy, or other significant legal issues that voters should understand?
5. What major controversies, scandals, or ethical concerns have surrounded this candidate?
6. What demonstrably false or materially misleading public claims has this candidate made in the last 30 days, based on verifiable reporting and primary-source evidence?
7. What is this candidate's long-term record of truthfulness, accuracy, and public credibility?
8. Who materially or politically benefits the most if this candidate wins?
9. Who is most likely to be harmed, excluded, or disadvantaged by this candidate's agenda?
10. What does this candidate's social media history reveal about their priorities, behavior, and public conduct?
11. What are this candidate's core policy positions explained in plain, non-technical language?
12. What office is this candidate seeking, and what formal powers and responsibilities come with that office?

These are the questions the mainstream media rarely asks. Quarex is designed to help you dig deeper.

As always, candidate content is updated every Friday.

Best,
Peter
