<p>With 825 books across dozens of shelves and seven library types, Quarex had a discovery problem. You could search. You could browse. But you couldn't <em>see</em> the whole thing at once.</p>

<p>Now you can.</p>

<h2>The Library Navigator</h2>

<p>The Library Navigator is an interactive map of the entire Quarex taxonomy—all seven library types, every library, and every shelf, displayed as a clickable visual hierarchy.</p>

<div class="callout blue">
<p><strong>What you can do:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>See the full structure</strong>—825 books organized across Event, Geography, Knowledge, Infrastructure, Perspectives, Politicians, and Practical libraries</li>
  <li><strong>Zoom and pan</strong>—scroll to zoom, drag to explore different areas</li>
  <li><strong>Click any node</strong>—jump directly to that library type, library, or shelf</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>This solves a real problem. With hundreds of books organized into a deep hierarchy, it's easy to miss what's available. The Navigator shows you everything, organized visually. In one glance, you can see the entire knowledge structure.</p>

<h2>The Ecosystem Navigator</h2>

<p>The Ecosystem Navigator shows all the Quarex properties in one view—the central platform and all the satellite sites that connect to it.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Libraries</strong>—825 Living Books, the core of everything</li>
  <li><strong>Public Studies</strong>—Curated curricula at publicstudies.org</li>
  <li><strong>Blog</strong>—Commentary and updates</li>
  <li><strong>Knowable Online</strong>—The university portal</li>
  <li><strong>Election 2026</strong>—Every Congressional race</li>
  <li><strong>Elecciones 2026</strong>—Spanish-language election coverage</li>
</ul>

<p>Click any node to navigate there instantly. It answers the question "What is Quarex, exactly?" with a picture instead of a paragraph.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>

<p>A platform with 825 books isn't useful if people can't find what they're looking for. These tools make discovery effortless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Library Navigator</strong> shows you the depth—every shelf, every topic area</li>
  <li>The <strong>Ecosystem Navigator</strong> shows you the breadth—every Quarex property, one click away</li>
</ul>

<p>Both load instantly and work on any device. Small files, fast performance. Built with D3.js for visualization—the same library used by the New York Times and Bloomberg for interactive graphics.</p>

<h2>Bonus: New Intelligence Community Book</h2>

<p>Also this week: a new 10-chapter book in the Security Infrastructure library covering America's 18-agency intelligence apparatus. Topics include the CIA, NSA, FBI, military intelligence agencies, congressional oversight, civil liberties tensions, cyber threats, and intelligence failures.</p>
