<p>California hasn't had a Republican governor since Arnold Schwarzenegger left office in 2011. Democrats enjoy a roughly 2:1 voter registration advantage. And yet, as the June 2026 primary approaches, Democratic strategists are losing sleep over a scenario that sounds absurd on its face: two Republican candidates advancing to the general election, shutting Democrats out entirely.</p>

<p>Welcome to the unintended consequences of California's top-two primary system.</p>

<h2>The Numbers Tell the Story</h2>

<p>The latest Emerson College poll (February 13-14, 2026) paints a stark picture:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Steve Hilton (R):</strong> 17%</li>
  <li><strong>Eric Swalwell (D):</strong> 14%</li>
  <li><strong>Chad Bianco (R):</strong> 14%</li>
  <li><strong>Katie Porter (D):</strong> 10%</li>
  <li><strong>Tom Steyer (D):</strong> 9%</li>
  <li><strong>Xavier Becerra (D):</strong> 4%</li>
  <li><strong>Matt Mahan (D):</strong> 3%</li>
  <li><strong>Antonio Villaraigosa (D):</strong> 3%</li>
  <li><strong>Betty Yee (D):</strong> 2%</li>
  <li><strong>Undecided:</strong> 21%</li>
</ul>

<p>Add up the Democratic vote and it dwarfs the Republican total. But under the top-two system&mdash;where only the two highest vote-getters advance to November regardless of party&mdash;aggregate totals are meaningless. What matters is individual candidate performance.</p>

<p>And that's where Democrats are in trouble.</p>

<h2>The Consolidation Gap</h2>

<p>The Republican electorate has naturally consolidated around just two candidates. Among GOP voters, it's essentially a coin flip: Hilton at 38% and Bianco at 37%. That's clean, efficient vote distribution.</p>

<p>The Democratic side is a different story entirely. Among Democratic voters, Swalwell leads with just 23%, followed by Porter at 14%, Steyer at 12%&mdash;and a devastating 22% still undecided. The vote is fragmented across at least six serious candidates, with no single Democrat pulling away from the pack.</p>

<p>Even if the lower-tier Democrats dropped out tomorrow, you're still left with four powerhouses who each have compelling reasons to stay in the race:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Swalwell</strong> has momentum and Adam Schiff's endorsement</li>
  <li><strong>Porter</strong> has high name recognition from her 2024 Senate run</li>
  <li><strong>Steyer</strong> has $28 million of his own money and can self-fund indefinitely</li>
  <li><strong>Villaraigosa</strong> is banking on consolidating Latino voter support</li>
</ul>

<p>That's four egos, four fundraising operations, and four campaign staffs&mdash;all drawing from the same Democratic well.</p>

<h2>Gerrymandering in Reverse</h2>

<p>Here's the uncomfortable parallel: this dynamic functions like gerrymandering in reverse.</p>

<p>Traditional gerrymandering dilutes the opposition's voting power by strategically spreading their voters across districts. California's top-two system can produce the same distortion&mdash;not by design, but by accident. The majority party's vote gets diluted across too many candidates while the minority party benefits from natural consolidation.</p>

<p>The result is identical: voter preference gets distorted. The mechanism is different&mdash;one is intentional manipulation, the other is emergent from misaligned incentives&mdash;but the democratic dysfunction is the same.</p>

<p>And it cuts both ways. This has happened to Republicans in Washington state's jungle primary and in California congressional races where two Democrats advanced. The system systematically punishes whichever party fields more competitive candidates. Think about that: a system that penalizes political parties for having <em>too much talent</em> willing to serve.</p>

<h2>The Ross Perot Playbook</h2>

<p>If you can't consolidate your own side, why not fragment theirs?</p>

<p>Ross Perot's 19% showing in 1992 didn't just make for interesting television&mdash;it fundamentally altered the race dynamics between Bush and Clinton. The spoiler effect is a proven force in American politics.</p>

<p>California has no shortage of potential Republican-adjacent candidates who could enter the governor's race&mdash;a tech libertarian, a moderate business Republican, someone from the anti-Trump wing. Each additional Republican candidate would dilute the Hilton-Bianco consolidation advantage.</p>

<p>Is it cynical? Absolutely. Is it unprecedented? Not even close. Both parties have historically funded candidates on the other side to create exactly this kind of fragmentation. It's the ugly machinery of electoral strategy that voters rarely see.</p>

<h2>The Absurdity Test</h2>

<p>Here's a thought experiment that reveals just how broken the incentive structure is: What if a lower-polling Democrat switched their party registration to Republican and re-entered the race?</p>

<p>It would never happen&mdash;career suicide, party loyalty, and future endorsements make it impossible. But the fact that it would be <em>strategically optimal</em> tells you everything you need to know about the system. When the rational move for a candidate involves switching parties based on arithmetic rather than ideology, the mechanism has a design flaw.</p>

<p>As any engineer will tell you: when the system produces perverse incentives where the rational individual action contradicts the intended system purpose, that's not a user error. That's a design flaw.</p>

<h2>What Happens Next</h2>

<p>The June 2 primary is still months away. Several things could shift the dynamic:</p>

<p><strong>The optimistic scenario for Democrats:</strong> Party leadership pressures lower-tier candidates to drop out. One candidate&mdash;probably Swalwell or Porter&mdash;emerges as the consensus choice. Democratic voters consolidate, and at least one Democrat comfortably makes the top two.</p>

<p><strong>The nightmare scenario:</strong> Pride, money, and ambition keep all major candidates in the race. Steyer's billions keep him on the air. Porter's independent brand resists party pressure. Swalwell and Villaraigosa both believe they can break through. The Democratic vote stays fragmented, and California&mdash;a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by millions&mdash;sends two Republicans to the general election.</p>

<p><strong>The wild card:</strong> That 21% undecided bloc. If those voters break decisively toward a single Democrat, the fragmentation problem solves itself. But undecided voters in multi-candidate fields tend to scatter, not consolidate.</p>

<h2>The Bigger Lesson</h2>

<p>California's top-two primary was passed in 2010 (Proposition 14) with noble intentions: reduce partisan extremism, give voters more choices, and produce more moderate candidates. In many races, it has worked as designed.</p>

<p>But edge cases reveal system failures. And a governor's race with ten Democrats and two Republicans isn't an edge case anyone planned for&mdash;it's a structural vulnerability that was always embedded in the design.</p>

<p>This isn't a partisan observation. It's a systems observation. Electoral mechanisms shape outcomes in ways that most voters never see. Understanding these dynamics&mdash;gerrymandering, spoiler effects, vote fragmentation, consolidation advantages&mdash;isn't about rooting for one side or the other. It's about understanding how democracy actually works beneath the surface.</p>

<p>Because when the structure of the game determines the outcome more than the preferences of the players, every voter deserves to understand the rules.</p>
