<p>I built something I want to share with you. No catch, no subscription, no paywall. Just knowledge.</p>

<h2>What is Quarex?</h2>

<p>Quarex is a free knowledge platform with over 830 "living books" covering politics, history, culture, science, and practical skills. Every book is structured, sourced, and designed to help you understand complex topics—not just skim them.</p>

<p>You can browse. You can search. Or you can just <em>ask</em>.</p>

<div class="callout blue">
<p><strong>Ask Quarex anything:</strong> "What are the arguments for and against universal healthcare?" or "Who's running for Congress in my district?" or "How did the civil rights movement succeed?" — and get a real, sourced answer.</p>
</div>

<h2>Why Free?</h2>

<p>Because knowledge shouldn't be locked behind paywalls. Because informed citizens make better decisions. Because I believe access to good information is a public good.</p>

<p>This is my contribution. Use it, share it, learn something new.</p>
