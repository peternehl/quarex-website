# Everybody Counts or Nobody Counts - Blog Series

## Concept
Apply the same principled frame across multiple wedge issues: "Who counts as a full citizen?"

Each post documents the policy assault, then delivers the counter-frame: everybody counts or nobody counts.

## Priority Topics

   - Quarex: How Abortion Became a Political Wedge
   - Dobbs fallout, state bans, medical exceptions denied

2. **Healthcare Access** - Who deserves to stay alive?
   - May need new Quarex book
   - Medicaid cuts, ACA sabotage, prescription costs

3. **Climate** - Do future generations count?
   - Quarex: The Climate Question (includes Trump rollbacks chapter)
   - Regulatory rollbacks, who bears the costs

### Tier 2 (Later)
4. **Voting Rights** - Who gets to vote easily, who gets obstacles?
5. **Immigration** - Who's a "real" American?
   - Quarex: How Trump Subverted and Weaponized Immigration Reform
