    <strong>Subject:</strong> Partnership Inquiry from Quarex (Mission-Aligned Initiative)
</div>

<p>Mr. Chouinard,</p>

<p>I'll keep this brief. I know you value action over talk.</p>

<p>I built a free tool called <strong>Quarex</strong> that helps voters research political candidates before elections. It provides pre-loaded accountability questions for every candidate in federal races - questions about funding sources, conflicts of interest, truthfulness, and policy positions. Users paste these questions into AI assistants and get instant research on any candidate.</p>

<p>The tool currently covers 2,719 candidates across 454 races for 2026.</p>

<p><strong>Why I'm reaching out to you:</strong></p>

<p>Environmental policy doesn't happen in a vacuum. It happens through elections. And elections are increasingly won by candidates who exploit voter confusion rather than earn voter trust. George Santos fabricated his entire biography and got elected to Congress. Climate deniers get elected because voters don't know how to vet them.</p>

<p>You've spent decades fighting for the planet. But the politicians who decide environmental policy are chosen by voters who often lack the tools to tell the difference between candidates who will protect the environment and those who will sell it off. Quarex is an attempt to fix that upstream problem - not by telling people what to think, but by giving them the questions that reveal who candidates actually are.</p>

<p>The tool is free, non-commercial, and applies the same scrutiny to every candidate regardless of party.</p>

<p><strong>What I'm asking:</strong></p>

<p>I'm not asking for money. I'm asking whether this approach resonates with your thinking about systemic change. If it does, I'd welcome a conversation about how Quarex might connect with the broader ecosystem of organizations working on democratic participation and environmental protection. If One Percent for the Planet or the Holdfast Collective sees value in informed-voter infrastructure, I'd be grateful for any guidance or introductions.</p>

<p>If this isn't the right fit, no response needed. I respect your time.</p>

<p>Thank you for everything you've built and given away.</p>
