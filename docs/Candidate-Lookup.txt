This is the Quarex 2026 Candidate Lookup tool.

Enter your zip code. 
And get your candidates--

Senate, Governor, House--instantly.

Some zip codes cross district lines. 

When that happens, one click takes you to Census.gov to pick the right one. 

Done.

Why did I build this?

Because finding the truth about candidates has never been harder. 

Billionaires and PACs flood the airwaves with deceptive ads. 

Meanwhile, corporate media has largely abandoned investigative journalism--

chasing clicks and outrage instead of holding power accountable.

Two words: George Santos.

He waltzed into Congress because nobody ever asked him basic questions,

but Quarex does:

Who is this person?

Who funds this candidate's campaign, and in what approximate amounts?

What demonstrably false or materially misleading public claims has this candidate made in the last 30 days?

What does this candidate's social media history reveal about their priorities, behavior, and public conduct?

What major controversies, scandals, or ethical concerns have surrounded this candidate?

Does this candidate have a criminal record, history of bankruptcy, or other significant legal issues that voters should understand?

What conflicts of interest exist between this candidate's public role and their financial, business, or personal ties?

What is this candidate's long-term record of truthfulness, accuracy, and public credibility?

Who materially or politically benefits the most from this candidate's agenda?

Who is most likely to be harmed, excluded, or disadvantaged by this candidate's agenda?

What are this candidate's core policy positions explained in plain, non-technical language?

Use the Quarex. 

Ask the hard questions. 

Share it with your family and friends.

Billionaires win when their ads work.

Make their money worthless.

Quarex cuts through the algorithms, the bubbles, and the propaganda and gets straight to the facts.
