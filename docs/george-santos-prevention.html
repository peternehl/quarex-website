<h1>George Santos Prevention</h1>
<p class="subtitle">How one free tool gives you 11 accountability questions for 2,719 candidates</p>

<p>Remember George Santos? The congressman who fabricated his entire biography - fake jobs at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, fake degrees, fake charity work, fake heritage? Voters in NY-03 had no idea they were electing a con artist.</p>

<p>The problem wasn't that the information didn't exist. It's that nobody asked the right questions.</p>

<h2>What if there was a better way?</h2>

<p>I built <a href="https://quarex.org">Quarex</a> to solve exactly this problem. It's a free research tool that loads pre-written accountability questions for every candidate in the 2026 cycle:</p>

<table class="stats-table">
    <tr>
        <th>Race Type</th>
        <th>Races</th>
        <th>Candidates</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>House</td>
        <td>382 districts</td>
        <td>2,003</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Senate</td>
        <td>33 races</td>
        <td>319</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Governor</td>
        <td>39 races</td>
        <td>397</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Total</strong></td>
        <td><strong>454 races</strong></td>
        <td><strong>2,719 candidates</strong></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>The Questions That Would Have Caught Santos</h2>

<p>When you select a candidate on Quarex, it automatically generates questions like:</p>

<blockquote>"What false or misleading public claims has <strong>George Santos</strong> made in the last 30 days?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Does <strong>George Santos</strong> have a criminal record, history of bankruptcy, or any other significant legal issues?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"What conflicts of interest exist between <strong>George Santos</strong>'s public role and their financial, business, or personal ties?"</blockquote>

<p>These aren't gotcha questions. They're the basic due diligence every voter should be able to do - but rarely has time to formulate on their own.</p>

<h2>Beyond Candidates: The Executive and Judicial Branches</h2>

<p>Quarex doesn't stop at candidates. The site also includes research libraries for the <strong>Trump Administration cabinet</strong> - all 25 current officials from Pam Bondi to Pete Hegseth - with tailored questions about conflicts of interest, ethics violations, and policy positions. There's also a <strong>Supreme Court library</strong> covering all nine justices, with questions focused on judicial philosophy, controversial rulings, recusal issues, and the influence of their financial and political ties. These aren't running for office, but they're making decisions that affect your life. You should be able to research them too.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Go to <a href="https://quarex.org">quarex.org</a></li>
    <li>Select "Politician Research"</li>
    <li>Find your state and district</li>
    <li>Pick any candidate</li>
    <li>Copy a question and paste it into your favorite AI (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity)</li>
</ol>

<p>The AI does the research. You get the answers. The candidate gets scrutinized.</p>

<h2>It's Not Just For Republicans</h2>

<p>Every candidate is in there - Democratic, Republican, Independent, third party. The same questions apply to everyone. If your own party's candidate has skeletons, better to find out in the primary than after they're sworn in.</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>Quarex updates weekly as new candidates declare. The 2026 cycle is just getting started, and by November we'll have full coverage of every federal race.</p>

<p>The goal is simple: never let another George Santos happen because voters didn't know what questions to ask.</p>
