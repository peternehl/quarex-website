    <strong>Subject:</strong> Quarex - A Free Tool for Vetting Congressional Candidates
</div>

<p>Paul,</p>

<p>I wanted to share a tool I've been building called <a href="https://quarex.org">Quarex</a> that I think you'll find useful, especially given your interest in civic engagement and informed decision-making.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>George Santos proved that a congressional candidate can fabricate an entire biography - fake jobs, fake degrees, fake charity work - and still get elected. The information to catch him existed, but voters in NY-03 didn't know what questions to ask.</p>

<p>This isn't unique to Santos. Voters face 435 House races, 33 Senate races, and 39 Governor races in 2026. Nobody has time to develop a research framework for each one.</p>

<h2>What Quarex Does</h2>

<p>Quarex provides pre-loaded accountability questions for every candidate in every federal race. When you select a candidate, you get 11 research questions with their name automatically inserted:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Does {name} have a criminal record, history of bankruptcy, or any other significant legal issues?</li>
    <li>What false or misleading public claims has {name} made in the last 30 days?</li>
    <li>What conflicts of interest exist between {name}'s public role and their financial, business, or personal ties?</li>
    <li>Who funds {name}'s campaign, and in what approximate amounts?</li>
    <li>What is {name}'s long-term record of truthfulness, accuracy, and public credibility?</li>
</ul>

<p>You copy any question and paste it into an AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity). The AI does the research. You get the answers.</p>

<div class="example">
    Example: Select "John Smith (R)" from Ohio's 4th District, and the question becomes: "Does John Smith have a criminal record, history of bankruptcy, or any other significant legal issues?"
</div>

<h2>Current Coverage</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>2,003 candidates</strong> across 382 House districts</li>
    <li><strong>319 candidates</strong> across 33 Senate races</li>
    <li><strong>397 candidates</strong> across 39 Governor races</li>
</ul>

<p>Updated weekly as new candidates declare.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>

<p>The same questions apply to every candidate - Democratic, Republican, Independent. It's not about catching one party; it's about giving voters a consistent framework for due diligence that they otherwise wouldn't have.</p>

<p>Santos-style fraud succeeds when voters don't know what to ask. Quarex makes those questions available to everyone, for free, for every race.</p>

<p>Take a look when you have a chance: <a href="https://quarex.org">quarex.org</a></p>

<p>I'd welcome your thoughts.</p>
