I want to generate a voiceover for a script using my own voice from a previous video.
The solution must run entirely locally on Windows, use Python, and support GPU acceleration.
I want to use XTTS v2 or an equivalent open-source voice-cloning TTS model.

Requirements:

Use a short WAV voice sample (30–90 seconds)

Generate natural, neutral narration suitable for explainer videos

No cloud services, no accounts, no telemetry

Allow re-rendering of sections

Output clean WAV files

Please:

Install dependencies in a clean Python environment

Verify GPU usage

Provide a simple script or CLI workflow

Document how to change pacing and regenerate sections
