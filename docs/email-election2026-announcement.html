<h1>Introducing Election 2026</h1>

<p>I'm excited to share something new: <a href="https://election2026.net">election2026.net</a> — a free, nonpartisan site that lets any voter in the United States research their 2026 candidates and races.</p>

<p>It's built entirely on Quarex.</p>

<h2>What It Does</h2>

<p>Enter your zip code and immediately find your US House, Senate, and Governor races with links to in-depth, AI-powered candidate profiles. Every profile is a Quarex book — structured, sourced, and free of editorial spin.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<p>The site covers:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>435 House districts</strong> across all 50 states</li>
    <li><strong>34 Senate races</strong></li>
    <li><strong>39 Governor races</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Executive Branch</strong> — 26 officials including cabinet and senior positions</li>
    <li><strong>Supreme Court</strong> — all 9 justices</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>You can also browse by state (see which races are active in any state) or by branch of government.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Right now, voters trying to research candidates face a broken information landscape:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Editorial sites</strong> tell you what to think, filtered through whoever owns the publication</li>
    <li><strong>Horse-race coverage</strong> — the media obsesses over polls and fundraising totals while ignoring policy positions, voting records, and candidate character</li>
    <li><strong>Raw data sites</strong> dump information without helping you make sense of it</li>
    <li><strong>Social media</strong> amplifies noise designed to generate engagement, not understanding</li>
</ul>

<p>Billions of dollars are spent every cycle to shape what voters believe. Election 2026 is the opposite of that — no ads, no accounts, no tracking, no editorial filter. Just structured questions and sourced answers, powered by the same Quarex architecture you already know.</p>

<h2>Coming Soon: State Proposition Analysis</h2>

<p>The next major feature will be <strong>state proposition and ballot measure analysis</strong>. The same Quarex format that powers candidate profiles will be applied to ballot measures — what a proposition actually does in plain language, arguments for and against, fiscal impact, who supports and opposes it, and historical context.</p>

<p>This is something most voter guides do poorly. They either editorialize or dump raw legal text. Quarex's question-driven approach lets voters actually understand what they're voting on.</p>

<h2>How You Can Help</h2>

<p>If you find Election 2026 useful, the most valuable thing you can do is share it. The site is brand new and needs visibility. A few specific ways to help:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Share the link</strong> — <a href="https://election2026.net">election2026.net</a> — with anyone who votes</li>
    <li><strong>Mention it</strong> to civic organizations, educators, or community groups you're connected to</li>
    <li><strong>Try the zip code lookup</strong> and let me know if anything looks wrong or could be better</li>
</ul>

<p>The 2026 midterm cycle is starting now. Public trust in media is at historic lows. People are actively looking for nonpartisan, non-algorithmic sources of truth. Nothing else like this exists.</p>
