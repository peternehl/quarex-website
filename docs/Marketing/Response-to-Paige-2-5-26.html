  <h1>Response to Paige Rucker Orme</h1>
  <p class="meta">Draft prepared February 5, 2026</p>

  <p>Hi Paige,</p>

  <p>Thank you for a clean, professional response &mdash; I appreciate how clearly you received and aligned with the scope.</p>

  <h2>On &ldquo;delivery&rdquo; clarification</h2>
  <p>Agreed. Delivery means completion and handoff of defined deliverables for the selected option, not adoption outcomes. I&rsquo;ve included a proposed deliverable list with completion criteria in the attached deal memo &mdash; please review and confirm or revise as needed.</p>

  <h2>On metrics &mdash; a correction from my side</h2>
  <p>I want to be transparent. Quarex does run Google Analytics (GA4) on its core properties &mdash; quarex.org, the libraries hub, and the Ask tool. What it does <em>not</em> do is behavioral profiling, CRM tracking, or surveillance-style analytics. Standard aggregate page metrics exist. I should have been more precise in the counter-proposal when I said &ldquo;no analytics&rdquo; &mdash; the intent was no user-level tracking or marketing automation, not zero measurement.</p>

  <p>Given that GA4 already exists, your proposed lightweight metrics on the Momentum portal are completely fine &mdash; they&rsquo;d actually be less intrusive than what&rsquo;s already running. And if it&rsquo;s helpful, I can grant you read access to the GA4 property so you can correlate outreach timing with traffic patterns directly, rather than building separate measurement.</p>

  <p>Your proposed inquiry dashboard &mdash; forwarding explicit requests to me in real time, no CRM, no automation &mdash; works perfectly. That&rsquo;s exactly the right approach.</p>

  <h2>On benchmarks</h2>
  <p>Yes, please propose 30/60-day benchmarks. I&rsquo;d suggest weighting toward:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Institutional response quality (replies, meetings, material requests)</li>
    <li>Inquiry volume through the dashboard</li>
    <li>GA4 referral patterns that correlate with outreach batches</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>On scope</h2>
  <p>Let&rsquo;s proceed with <strong>Option&nbsp;3</strong> ($2,750). If outreach response quality meets benchmarks at 30&nbsp;days, I want to upgrade to <strong>Option&nbsp;4</strong> immediately &mdash; no re-scoping needed, just expand the outreach volume and time-on-task. Please structure the Option&nbsp;3 deliverables so they&rsquo;re forward-compatible with that upgrade path.</p>

  <h2>Portal walkthrough request</h2>
  <p>Before you begin building the portals, I&rsquo;d like a detailed walkthrough of the portal structure &mdash; which pages, what content on each, routing logic, and how the ecosystem sites (quarex.org, knowableonline.org, publicstudies.org, election2026.net) are represented. A wireframe or outline would be ideal.</p>

  <h2>What I need from you</h2>
  <p>Could you also provide a to-do list of everything you&rsquo;ll need from me to get started and stay unblocked &mdash; assets, access, copy, approvals, whatever it is? I&rsquo;d rather have it all mapped out upfront so I&rsquo;m not a bottleneck once work begins.</p>

  <h2>Deal memo</h2>
  <p>Before we kick off, I&rsquo;d like us both to sign off on a short deal memo that locks in the key terms &mdash; scope, deliverables, payment, expenses, timeline, ownership, and the upgrade trigger. I&rsquo;ve attached a draft spec for your review. If the structure works for you, we can finalize it quickly and get moving. If you&rsquo;d prefer a different format, happy to adapt &mdash; the goal is just to have everything in writing so we&rsquo;re both protected and aligned.</p>

  <p class="salutation">Ready to move quickly on this.</p>

  <p class="signature">Best,<br>Peter</p>
