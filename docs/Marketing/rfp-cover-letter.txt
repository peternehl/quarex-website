Subject: RFP: Digital Marketing Partner for Quarex.org - Civic Education Platform

Hi [Name/Team],

I'm Peter Nehl, founder of Quarex.org, a free AI-powered knowledge platform designed to help people access balanced, well-sourced information on complex topics.

I'm reaching out because [AGENCY NAME]'s work in [civic engagement / progressive causes / nonprofit communications] aligns with what we're building. We're looking for a digital marketing partner to help us reach 10,000 active users ahead of the 2026 midterms.

Attached is our formal RFP outlining the engagement:

- Budget: $5,000/month agency fee + $2,000/month ad spend
- Timeline: 3 months (January-March 2026)
- Goal: 10,000 users across truth-seeking voters, educators, and journalists
- Platform: Live at https://quarex.org

What makes Quarex different: We don't tell people what to think. We help them explore topics through ethical, AI-guided conversations grounded in vetted sources.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss whether this is a fit for your team. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to schedule a call.

Best regards,
Peter Nehl
