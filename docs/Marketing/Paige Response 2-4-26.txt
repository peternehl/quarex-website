Hi Peter,

Thank you for such a thoughtful and thorough counter proposal. I’m fully aligned with the direction you outlined, and I appreciate how clearly you articulated both the expanded scope of the Quarex ecosystem and the principles that need to guide this work.

I’m comfortable with the adjusted scope and the engagement options as you’ve laid them out. Adapting the portals to reflect the full ecosystem strengthens the story and makes the experience more accurate and useful for every audience. We’ll stay strictly grounded in what exists today, use real numbers only, and keep all examples clearly aspirational where needed. Trust remains the foundation.

On payment terms, I’m aligned with what you proposed. Invoicing upon delivery with Net 7 terms works well, as does the monthly hosting and maintenance fee. I also agree with batch-based invoicing for outreach execution in Options 3 and 4. That structure keeps scope clear and makes progress easy to measure. The only clarification I’d suggest, purely for mutual clarity, is that “delivery” refers to the completion and handoff of the defined deliverables for the selected option, rather than specific adoption outcomes.

On measurement, I agree that institutional response quality should remain the primary signal. Replies, meetings, requests for materials, and confirmations of deployment are far more meaningful than traffic metrics for this kind of work.

In addition, I want to note that the landing experience I’m building can be SEO and AEO optimized to improve discoverability and clarity without tracking users. If you’re comfortable, we can also include very lightweight, aggregate metrics on that front page only, such as which portals are selected or how clearly users route themselves.  It’s simply a way to assess whether the messaging and routing are doing their job. 

Separately, I can include a simple backend inquiry dashboard tied only to explicit actions like requests for materials, partnership questions, or investor inquiries. Those inquiries can be forwarded directly to you in real time, and Quarex would fully own those relationships. No CRM, no automation, and no tracking beyond what someone intentionally submits.

If helpful, I’m happy to propose a short set of simple benchmarks for 30 and 60 days that incorporate outreach responses, inquiry volume, and qualitative feedback so we’re aligned on what “working” looks like before we begin.

In terms of scope, Option 3 is a solid pilot. Option 4 is what I’d recommend if the goal is to generate enough outreach volume and time-on-task to really learn what resonates and iterate based on real feedback. That said, I’m comfortable starting with whichever option best matches your comfort level and expanding once we see response quality.

I’m excited about the alignment here and confident this approach respects Quarex’s principles while giving it a real path to adoption.

Let me know how you’d like to proceed, and I’m happy to move quickly once we confirm the option and benchmarks.

Best,

Paige
