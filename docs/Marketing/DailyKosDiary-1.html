<h1>After George Santos, We Need Better Tools to Research Candidates Before We Vote</h1>

<p>Remember George Santos?</p>

<p>A congressman elected in 2022 whose entire biography turned out to be fabricated — fake degrees, fake jobs, fake charitable work. By the time journalists dug into his background, he was already sworn in.</p>

<p>The uncomfortable truth: voters didn't have the tools to verify his claims before Election Day. And Santos wasn't uniquely deceptive — he was just uniquely bad at it.</p>

<h2>This is the problem I'm trying to solve.</h2>

<p>I've been building <strong><a href="https://election2026.net">Election2026.net</a></strong>, part of a larger project called <a href="https://quarex.org">Quarex.org</a> — what I call a "curiosity engine" for exploring complex topics. The idea is simple: instead of reading a static bio that a campaign wrote, you can <em>ask questions</em> about a candidate and get sourced answers.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Where did they actually work?</li>
    <li>What have they said about specific issues?</li>
    <li>Who's funding their campaign?</li>
    <li>What's their voting record (for incumbents)?</li>
</ul>

<p>The system pulls from structured data and provides citations. Not opinions. Not spin. Facts you can verify.</p>

<h2>Why this matters for 2026:</h2>

<p>Right now, over 1,500 candidates have declared for House, Senate, and Governor races. Most voters won't hear about their candidates until October — if ever. By then, it's too late to do real research.</p>

<p>The candidate data on Election2026.net updates weekly from Ballotpedia. Every declared candidate across all 435 House districts, 34 Senate races, and 36 Governor races is already there, organized and explorable.</p>

<h2>What makes Quarex different from a Google search:</h2>

<p>Google gives you a wall of links. Campaign sites give you propaganda. Wikipedia is often outdated or non-existent for down-ballot candidates.</p>

<p>Quarex structures information into what I call "Living Books" — AI-powered research tools that let you interrogate a topic rather than passively consume it. Ask a question, get an answer with sources. Follow up. Dig deeper.</p>

<h2>The goal: No more George Santoses.</h2>

<p>No more "we didn't know" after the election.</p>

<p>This is part of a broader ecosystem I'm building:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://quarex.org">Quarex.org</a> — the core curiosity engine (600+ topics)</li>
    <li><a href="https://election2026.net">Election2026.net</a> — 2026 candidate research</li>
    <li><a href="https://knowableonline.org">Knowable Online University</a> — educational courses</li>
    <li><a href="https://publicstudies.org">Public Studies</a> — civic information</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd rather have people stress-test this now, while primaries are still forming, than wait until it's too late to matter.</p>

<p>Hey folks — longtime lurker, first-time diarist.</p>

<p>I'm a software developer who got fed up watching misinformation slip through the cracks every election cycle. After Santos, I started asking: why don't we have better tools for this?</p>

<p>So I built one. It's free, it's open, and it's not trying to sell you anything. Just trying to make it easier to know who's actually running in your district and what they're actually about.</p>

<p>Happy to answer any questions about how it works, the tech behind it, or where I'm hoping to take it. And if you find bugs or missing candidates, let me know — the data updates weekly so I can fix things fast.</p>
