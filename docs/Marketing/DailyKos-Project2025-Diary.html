<h1>I Built a Free Tool to Help People Actually Understand Project 2025 — And It's Just the Beginning</h1>

<p class="meta">by Peter Nehl | February 2026</p>

<p>Like many of you, I spent 2024 trying to explain Project 2025 to people who either hadn't heard of it or dismissed it as "conspiracy theory." Now we're watching it unfold in real time, and I wanted to do something more useful than doom-scrolling.</p>

<p>So I built something.</p>

<h2>What Is This?</h2>

<p><a href="https://quarex.org">Quarex</a> is a free knowledge platform I've been developing — 750 books across dozens of topics, all designed to help people escape information bubbles through guided inquiry rather than algorithmic feeds. No ads, no paywalls, no data harvesting. Just structured learning powered by AI.</p>

<p>Today I'm announcing the first book in what will become a comprehensive <strong>Project 2025 shelf</strong>:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://quarex.org/libraries/pe/ideological/project-2025/overview">Project 2025: Overview</a></strong></p>

<p>It's 12 chapters covering everything from the Heritage Foundation's history with presidential transitions to real-time implementation tracking. Each chapter contains 5-6 questions you can click to explore — and the AI provides sourced, detailed answers that invite further exploration.</p>

<h2>What the Overview Covers</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Origins and Architecture</strong> — The Heritage Foundation's "Mandate for Leadership" tradition, the 100+ coalition organizations, and how the four pillars work together</li>
    <li><strong>The Mandate for Leadership</strong> — What the 920-page document actually says, who wrote which sections, and the dark money behind it</li>
    <li><strong>Personnel Is Policy</strong> — Schedule F, the personnel database, the training academy, and why they believe staffing is everything</li>
    <li><strong>Executive Power</strong> — Unitary executive theory, "deconstructing the administrative state," and what it means for independent agencies</li>
    <li><strong>Social and Cultural Agenda</strong> — Reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ policy, education, DEI, and the role of Christian nationalism</li>
    <li><strong>Economic Vision</strong> — Tax policy, financial deregulation, and what happens to Social Security and Medicare</li>
    <li><strong>Energy and Environment</strong> — Fossil fuel expansion, EPA gutting, Paris Agreement withdrawal</li>
    <li><strong>Immigration</strong> — Mass deportation logistics, asylum policy, military border enforcement</li>
    <li><strong>Defense and Foreign Policy</strong> — NATO skepticism, intelligence community restructuring, "woke military" purges</li>
    <li><strong>Media and Free Speech</strong> — FCC restructuring, public broadcasting defunding, government narrative control</li>
    <li><strong>Implementation Tracking</strong> — Which proposals are already executive orders, which authors now hold power, and court challenges</li>
    <li><strong>The Debate</strong> — Arguments from supporters, critics, and constitutional scholars</li>
</ul>

<h2>More Books Coming</h2>

<p>The Overview is just the starting point. I'm planning to build out the Project 2025 shelf with deep-dive books on specific topics:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Schedule F and the Civil Service</strong> — The full history, legal basis, and implications of politicizing 50,000+ federal jobs</li>
    <li><strong>Agency Deep Dives</strong> — Dedicated books for DOJ/FBI, EPA, Education, HHS, DHS, and Defense</li>
    <li><strong>The Unitary Executive</strong> — Constitutional theory, historical precedents, and where it leads</li>
    <li><strong>Christian Nationalism in Project 2025</strong> — Tracing the ideological roots and policy manifestations</li>
    <li><strong>Implementation Tracker</strong> — A living book updated as policies roll out and courts respond</li>
    <li><strong>The Coalition</strong> — Profiles of the 100+ organizations, their funding, and their specific policy wins</li>
    <li><strong>Resistance Playbook</strong> — Legal challenges, state-level countermeasures, and civic action</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why This Format?</h2>

<p>I'm a retired broadcast engineer, not a journalist. But I've spent years watching how information gets distorted, siloed, and weaponized. Quarex is my attempt to build something different:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Structured, not scrollable</strong> — You explore topics through questions, not endless feeds</li>
    <li><strong>AI-powered, but grounded</strong> — Answers come from Google's Gemini with search grounding, so they cite real sources</li>
    <li><strong>Rabbit holes encouraged</strong> — Every answer generates follow-up questions, so you can go as deep as you want</li>
    <li><strong>Permanently free</strong> — No premium tier, no "subscribe for more." This is founder-funded and staying that way.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Try It</h2>

<p>Start here: <a href="https://quarex.org/libraries/pe/ideological/project-2025/overview">Project 2025: Overview</a></p>

<p>Or explore the whole platform: <a href="https://quarex.org">quarex.org</a></p>

<p>If you find it useful, share it. If you have suggestions for what the next Project 2025 book should cover, drop a comment. I'm building this in the open and I want it to be useful to people who are trying to understand what's happening — and what to do about it.</p>
