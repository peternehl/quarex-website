  <h1>Strategic Asset: Hispanic Studies + Multilingual Election Info</h1>
  <p class="meta">February 8, 2026 — For Paige Rucker Orme</p>

  <p>Paige,</p>

  <p>I want to flag something that emerged this week that I think has significant marketing potential — possibly worth building a campaign around.</p>

  <h2>The Differentiator: 13-Language Election Information</h2>
  <p>Election2026.net now provides candidate information in 13 languages: English, Spanish, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Vietnamese, Korean, Tagalog, Arabic, French, German, Russian, Hindi, Portuguese, and Japanese.</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Who else does this? Nobody.</strong><br><br>
    Ballotpedia is English-only. Vote Smart is English-only. The major news outlets cover elections in English, sometimes Spanish. We're offering genuine multilingual civic access at a scale that doesn't exist elsewhere.
  </div>

  <h2>The Trust-Building Entry Point: Hispanic Studies</h2>
  <p>This week we launched four complete curricula under the Hispanic Studies umbrella — 79 courses covering:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hispanic Cultures &amp; Identity in America</li>
    <li>U.S.-Latin America Relations</li>
    <li>The Hispanic American Experience Today</li>
    <li>Hispanic Contributions to American Culture</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The content originates in English but the AI delivers answers and generates follow-up questions in Spanish — making it genuinely accessible to Spanish-dominant learners and heritage speakers.</p>

  <h2>The Strategy: Respect First, Then Civic Engagement</h2>
  <p>Here's what I realized: you can't walk into a community and say "let me tell you who to vote for." You have to demonstrate respect first.</p>

  <p>Hispanic Studies does that. It says: <em>Your history matters. Your contributions are foundational to this country. We took the time to document it properly.</em></p>

  <p>Once that credibility is established, the same platform can deliver honest, accessible election information — in Spanish or any of 12 other languages — and be trusted.</p>

  <h2>Marketing Angle</h2>
  <p>I see two possible approaches:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lead with the unique:</strong> "The only election resource available in 13 languages" — emphasize civic accessibility and underserved communities</li>
    <li><strong>Lead with the cultural:</strong> Position Hispanic Studies as the entry point, with election info as a natural extension of our commitment to the community</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Either way, the combination of deep cultural content + unprecedented multilingual election access is something we can own. It's not a feature — it's a positioning.</p>

  <p>Interested in your thoughts on how to leverage this.</p>
