How Trump Broke the News

Part 1: Trump as a Profit Engine

In the beginning, Trump didn't just dominate the news. He powered it.

Ratings spiked. Clicks exploded. Advertising revenue surged. Outrage became a business model.

News outlets learned that Trump wasn't just a political figure—he was a guaranteed audience magnet. Every rally, every insult, every late-night post delivered attention on demand. And attention, in modern media, is money.

That created a structural conflict: the same behavior that degraded journalism also paid for it. Once outrage became profitable, the truth became optional.

Part 2: Sanewashing and the "Banality of Crazy"

Political scientist Brian Klaas calls this normalization "the banality of crazy."

Faced with constant falsehoods and incoherent speech, much of the media adapted by sanewashing. Trump's rambling monologues were reframed as strategy. His conspiracy theories were reported without their most extreme claims. His crude insults were softened into jokes or wordplay. And his outright lies were buried beneath unrelated policy coverage.

Journalists are trained to clarify, but now they distort. "Making sense" out of nonsense has turned reporters into enablers instead of watchdogs. The result isn't balance—it's bullshit.

Part 3: Lawsuits, Regulation, and Fear

Trump didn't just exploit the media's incentives. He threatened its foundations.

He attacks reporters by name. He punishes with billion-dollar lawsuits. He's weaponizing the FCC and regulatory power against critical outlets.

The goal is to intimidate. Baseless legal threats excite his followers and drain time and money from his targets. And when fear enters the newsroom, self-censorship follows. That pressure doesn't need to silence everyone—just the few honest journalists left who report the truth.

Part 4: How Journalism Recovers

Recovery starts with precision and courage.

If a claim is false, say it's false. If there's no evidence, say so—and say it clearly. If a statement is incoherent, don't repair it. And when lies repeat, explain the purpose they serve.

Stop false equivalence. Opinions are not facts.

Restore context—historical, social, and political—especially when rhetoric echoes authoritarian or conspiratorial movements.

Most importantly, journalism must stop chasing normalization and return to its core mission: not to entertain, not to balance outrage, but to help the public understand reality—even when that reality is uncomfortable.

Because once truth becomes optional, democracy dies. And no free society survives that bargain.
