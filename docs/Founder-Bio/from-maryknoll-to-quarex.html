        <h1>From Maryknoll to Quarex</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A Life Story in One Thread</p>
        <p class="byline">Peter Nehl — February 2026</p>

        <p class="intro">This is a summary of a conversation I had with an AI assistant about my life and work. I wanted to share it because it helped me see how everything connects.</p>

        <h2>The Seminary Kid</h2>

        <p>Did you know I studied for the Catholic priesthood as a young teenager? I was at the Maryknoll seminary in Mountain View, California. Only lasted a year and a half before I figured out it wasn't for me.</p>

        <p>But here's the thing — Maryknoll wasn't just any seminary. It was the missionary order. Their whole philosophy was going out into the world to serve people, especially in underserved communities. Service before preaching. That stuck with me, even after I left.</p>

        <h2>The Army Intelligence Years</h2>

        <p>In the early 1970s, I joined the Army Security Agency (ASA) as an electronics technician with a top-secret clearance. My job was maintaining highly classified signals intelligence equipment — basically the systems that intercepted and processed foreign communications during the Cold War.</p>

        <p>I was stationed first in Thailand at the 7th Radio Research Field Station for training, then at Field Station Augsburg in Germany — one of the premier intelligence sites in Europe, right on the front line against the Soviet bloc.</p>

        <p>The equipment I worked on was cutting-edge for its time. The main system was called the AN/FLR-9, nicknamed the "Elephant Cage" — a massive circular antenna array about 1,500 feet across. Inside the central building was some of the most advanced electronics of the era.</p>

        <p>One thing I worked on was the huge signal-routing system — an 800x600 matrix (The Cross) that could connect any antenna beam to any receiver. It used germanium transistors on removable cards, wire-wrapped backplanes, and a three-layer architecture that let it route signals without blocking other connections. This was cutting edge back in the early 70's.</p>

        <p>And DEC PDP-11 computers. When they crashed, we had to restart them by toggling binary code into the front panel switches by hand, bit by bit, just to get the paper tape reader working so we could reload the software from rolls of paper tape. Hours of work with paper tape all over the floor if something went wrong.</p>

        <h2>The Broadcast Years</h2>

        <p>After the Army, I went to work at Grass Valley Group in California — the leading manufacturer of broadcast television equipment back then. Engineering and Field Service, traveling the country fixing stuff. A TV network once flew me out to Tampa to fix their broadcast switcher, right before the NFC championship game, and then they gave me a free ticket to the game, nosebleed of course. The LA Rams won that game.</p>

        <p>I spent decades in broadcast engineering, always in infrastructure roles — building and maintaining the systems that let the signal get through. When you do it right, you're invisible, and the audience just gets what they need.</p>

        <h2>The Thread That Connects It All</h2>

        <p>Looking back, I've never been in a role where I controlled the message. I've always been the one building the infrastructure that lets truth travel — the signal paths, the systems, the platforms.</p>

        <p>Maryknoll taught service before doctrine. The Army reinforced it — a good technician serves the mission and the people depending on the equipment. Broadcast engineering was the same — invisible service infrastructure.</p>

        <p>Now, at 73, I'm building <a href="https://quarex.org">Quarex</a> — a free, AI-powered knowledge platform with over 800 books covering politics, history, culture, and practical skills. No ads, no paywalls, no data harvesting. Just structured knowledge that anyone can explore.</p>

        <p>It's the same impulse from Maryknoll, just with different tools. Taking knowledge and truth to people who need it. The core principle I work from: <strong>"Everybody counts or nobody counts."</strong></p>

        <div class="pullquote">
            "The Venn diagram of people who hand-toggled PDP-11 bootstrap loaders, maintained classified electronics in Cold War intelligence facilities, worked the broadcast engineering revolution, and are now building AI-powered knowledge platforms — that's a circle of one."
            <cite>— From a conversation with Claude, by Anthropic</cite>
        </div>

        <p>Maybe so. But the thread has always been the same: the true leader serves the people he leads. Build the infrastructure. Keep the path open. Let the signal get through.</p>

        <p>That's my vocation. I just found the right expression of it late in the game.</p>

        <div class="closing">
            <p>I have to have these conversations periodically to remember why I work. Building something this big, mostly alone — it's easy to get lost in the daily grind. These conversations help me recalibrate my compass and remember where it all started.</p>
