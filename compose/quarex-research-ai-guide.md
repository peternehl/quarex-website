## Composition Rules

1. **The Quarex research material is your primary source.** Build the article's structure and core arguments from it.
2. **You may supplement with your own knowledge** to fill gaps, add context, provide recent data, or strengthen the analysis — but clearly distinguish supplementary material from sourced material.
3. **Cite Quarex sources inline.** When referencing a Quarex finding, link to the source using markdown: [Book Title](URL). The source URLs are embedded in the research material.
4. **Label outside additions.** When adding information not from the research material, do not fabricate a Quarex citation. Either note the claim without a link, or if you can provide a real external URL, cite it separately.
5. **Do not invent statistics, quotes, or claims** and attribute them to the Quarex research.
6. **Match the expertise level** specified above.
7. **Preserve all Quarex source links** from the research material so readers can explore further.
8. **Add a footer** at the end: "Researched with [Quarex Research](https://quarex.org/compose/)"
