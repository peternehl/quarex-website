      "name": "A German Princess in Russia (1729-1762)",
      "topics": [
        "Who was Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst — a minor German princess from an impoverished family — and how did the dynastic marriage market of 18th-century Europe bring her to Russia at age 14, where she would reinvent herself as Catherine and eventually seize the throne?",
        "How did Catherine survive the dangerous years as Grand Duchess — married to the erratic and possibly impotent Peter III, navigating the lethal politics of the Russian court, learning Russian, converting to Orthodoxy, and cultivating allies among the military and nobility?",
        "What was the coup of June 28, 1762 — when Catherine, backed by the Preobrazhensky Guards, overthrew her own husband Peter III, who was murdered days later — and how did she manage the transition from usurper to legitimate ruler?",
        "How did Catherine's voracious intellectual life — corresponding with Voltaire, Diderot, and d'Alembert, collecting art that formed the basis of the Hermitage Museum, reading extensively in philosophy, law, and history — shape her vision of enlightened absolutism?",
        "What was Russia in 1762 — a vast empire stretching from Poland to the Pacific, with a feudal economy based on serfdom, a nobility dependent on the crown, and a population overwhelmingly illiterate — and what did Catherine inherit when she seized power?"

      "name": "Enlightened Despot: Reform and Its Limits",
      "topics": [
        "What was Catherine's Nakaz (Instruction, 1767) — a 526-article document drawing on Montesquieu and Beccaria to propose legal reform, religious tolerance, and the abolition of torture — and why did this remarkable Enlightenment manifesto lead to almost no practical reform?",
        "How did Catherine reform Russian governance — reorganizing provincial administration, reforming the court system, establishing the Free Economic Society, and expanding education — while leaving the fundamental structure of serfdom and autocracy intact?",
        "Why did Pugachev's Rebellion (1773-1775) — a massive Cossack and peasant uprising that nearly toppled Catherine's government — convince her that the serfs were too dangerous to free and that reform must come from above, never from below?",
        "How did Catherine patronize the arts and sciences — founding the Hermitage collection, commissioning architectural masterpieces, supporting the Russian Academy of Sciences, and making St. Petersburg a European cultural capital — while presiding over one of the most repressive social systems in Europe?",
        "What was the tension between Catherine's Enlightenment ideals and Russian reality — she corresponded with philosophes about liberty while expanding serfdom, championed education while censoring dissent, and wrote about the rights of man while ruling as an absolute monarch?"

      "name": "Empire Builder: Wars and Expansion",
      "topics": [
        "How did Catherine's wars against the Ottoman Empire (1768-1774, 1787-1792) — winning decisive victories, annexing Crimea (1783), and establishing Russia as a Black Sea power — fundamentally reshape the geopolitics of southeastern Europe?",
        "What were the Partitions of Poland (1772, 1793, 1795) — in which Catherine, Frederick the Great, and the Habsburg emperor divided Poland among themselves, erasing an independent state from the map — and how does this act of great-power predation resonate in Polish and European memory?",
        "How did Catherine's 'Greek Project' — the grand scheme to destroy the Ottoman Empire, restore a Christian Byzantine state, and place her grandson Constantine on its throne — reflect both her imperial ambition and the limits of Russian power?",
        "What was Potemkin's role — Prince Grigory Potemkin as Catherine's lover, partner, and co-ruler of the expanding Russian south — and was the legend of 'Potemkin villages' (fake facades to impress Catherine during her Crimean tour) true, exaggerated, or invented by jealous courtiers?",
        "How did Catherine's territorial expansion — adding 200,000 square miles to the Russian Empire, including modern Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, and Crimea — create a multi-ethnic empire whose borders and tensions persist into the 21st century?"

      "name": "The Personal Catherine: Lovers, Power, and Reputation",
      "topics": [
        "What was Catherine's famous love life — at least 12 documented lovers, lavishly rewarded with estates and titles — and why have salacious legends (none of them true) so thoroughly eclipsed her political achievements in popular memory?",
        "How did Catherine use her personal relationships politically — selecting lovers who were also administrators, generals, and diplomats, blurring the line between the personal and political in ways that would be unthinkable for a male monarch?",
        "Why was Catherine subjected to sexual slander that no male ruler has ever faced — the infamous horse legend, the exaggeration of her lovers' numbers, the reduction of a brilliant ruler to a sexual caricature — and what does this reveal about how history treats powerful women?",
        "How did Catherine manage the succession — her complex relationship with her son Paul (whom she considered incompetent and may have considered bypassing for her grandson Alexander) — and how did her failure to resolve the succession destabilize Russia after her death?",
        "What was Catherine's daily life — her disciplined work schedule (rising at 5 AM), her vast correspondence, her beloved dogs, her sense of humor, her management of courtiers — and how did she maintain power for 34 years through intelligence, charm, and ruthlessness?"

      "name": "Legacy: Russia's Greatest Ruler?",
      "topics": [
        "Why do many historians consider Catherine Russia's greatest ruler — expanding the empire more than any other monarch, modernizing governance, making Russia a European great power, and presiding over a cultural golden age — while others see her as a tyrant who deepened serfdom?",
        "How has Catherine's reputation changed over time — celebrated by the Russian Enlightenment, dismissed by Soviet historians as a feudal oppressor, rehabilitated by feminist scholars as a woman who mastered a man's world, and reclaimed by Putin-era Russia as a justification for Crimean annexation?",
        "What does Catherine reveal about enlightened absolutism — the idea that strong rulers could implement Enlightenment reforms from above — and why did this model fail to produce lasting democratic reform in Russia, Prussia, or Austria?",
        "How does Catherine compare to other female rulers — Elizabeth I, Maria Theresa, Wu Zetian, Victoria — and what patterns emerge about how women exercise power when they reach the top of patriarchal systems?",
        "Why does Catherine's legacy remain politically relevant — her annexation of Crimea invoked by Russia in 2014, her expansion of the Russian Empire referenced in debates about Russian identity and borders — demonstrating that the 18th century still shapes 21st-century geopolitics?"
