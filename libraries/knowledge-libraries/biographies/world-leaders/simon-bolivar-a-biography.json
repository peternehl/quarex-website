        "Who was the young Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar \u2014 born into one of the wealthiest families in Venezuela, orphaned by age nine, heir to cacao plantations and enslaved laborers \u2014 and how did this privileged creole become the liberator of six South American nations?",
        "How did Bol\u00edvar's education under Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez \u2014 a radical follower of Rousseau who taught his student to question authority, reject colonial subservience, and think about liberty \u2014 plant the seeds of revolution in an aristocrat's mind?",
        "What did Bol\u00edvar see during his travels in Europe (1799-1807) \u2014 Napoleon's coronation, the aftermath of the French Revolution, the Enlightenment ferment in Madrid and Paris \u2014 and how did his famous vow on Monte Sacro in Rome ('I swear I shall not rest until I have broken the chains that bind us to Spain') crystallize his life's mission?",
        "What was Spanish colonial society in South America \u2014 a rigid hierarchy of peninsulares (Spanish-born), creoles (American-born whites), mestizos, indigenous peoples, and enslaved Africans \u2014 and why did creoles like Bol\u00edvar, privileged within the system, nonetheless seek to destroy it?",
        "How did the Napoleonic invasion of Spain (1808) \u2014 deposing the Spanish king and creating a power vacuum \u2014 provide the opening for South American independence movements, with Bol\u00edvar and others seizing the moment to declare self-governance?"

        "How did the First Venezuelan Republic fail (1811-1812) \u2014 declared independence, crushed by royalist forces and a devastating earthquake that destroyed republican cities \u2014 and how did Bol\u00edvar's 'Manifesto of Cartagena' analyze the failure and demand a more centralized, ruthless approach to liberation?",
        "What was the Admirable Campaign of 1813 \u2014 Bol\u00edvar's lightning march from Colombia to Caracas, defeating royalist forces in a series of brilliant engagements \u2014 and why did his declaration of 'war to the death' against Spaniards mark a brutal escalation?",
        "How did Bol\u00edvar's crossing of the Andes in 1819 \u2014 leading 2,500 soldiers over 13,000-foot passes in freezing conditions, losing a third of his army \u2014 achieve the surprise that led to the decisive Battle of Boyac\u00e1 and the liberation of Colombia?",
        "What was the Battle of Carabobo (June 24, 1821) \u2014 the engagement that effectively ended Spanish rule in Venezuela \u2014 and how did Bol\u00edvar's use of British and Irish volunteer legions alongside Venezuelan llaneros (plainsmen) demonstrate the international dimension of South American liberation?",
        "How did the Battle of Ayacucho (December 9, 1824) \u2014 fought by Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, Bol\u00edvar's most trusted general \u2014 end 300 years of Spanish colonial rule in South America and complete the military liberation that Bol\u00edvar had dedicated his life to achieving?"

        "What was Bol\u00edvar's dream of Gran Colombia \u2014 a united republic comprising modern Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama \u2014 and why did he believe that only a large, powerful state could resist reconquest by Spain and the ambitions of the United States?",
        "How did the Congress of Angostura (1819) and the Congress of C\u00facuta (1821) attempt to create constitutional governance for Gran Colombia \u2014 and why did Bol\u00edvar's desire for a strong executive clash with republican demands for federalism and local autonomy?",
        "What was Bol\u00edvar's position on slavery \u2014 he freed his own enslaved people, recruited enslaved Venezuelans into the liberation army with promises of freedom, and pushed for gradual abolition \u2014 while the economies he liberated remained dependent on forced labor?",
        "How did the Congress of Panama (1826) \u2014 Bol\u00edvar's attempt to create a hemispheric alliance of former Spanish colonies \u2014 fail due to national rivalries, geographic distances, and the unwillingness of newly independent states to surrender sovereignty?",
        "Why did Bol\u00edvar's continental vision fail \u2014 Gran Colombia fragmenting into Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador by 1830, his plans for a Latin American federation rejected \u2014 and what does this failure reveal about the tension between visionary leadership and political reality?"

        "How did Bol\u00edvar's final years become a tragedy \u2014 the Liberator increasingly authoritarian, declaring himself dictator, surviving assassination attempts, watching his life's work fragment \u2014 as the very generals and politicians he had liberated turned against him?",
        "What was the assassination attempt of September 25, 1828 \u2014 when conspirators stormed the presidential palace in Bogot\u00e1 and Bol\u00edvar escaped by jumping from a window while his lover Manuela S\u00e1enz held off the attackers \u2014 and how did it embitter him further?",
        "Who was Manuela S\u00e1enz \u2014 the Ecuadorian revolutionary who became Bol\u00edvar's companion, saved his life, participated in military campaigns, and was one of the most remarkable women of the independence era \u2014 yet was largely erased from official history?",
        "How did Bol\u00edvar die on December 17, 1830 \u2014 impoverished, exiled, suffering from tuberculosis, at age 47 \u2014 reportedly saying 'all who served the revolution have plowed the sea' \u2014 and what did his death at the moment of his movement's fragmentation reveal?",
        "Why did Bol\u00edvar shift from liberator to dictator \u2014 arguing that South America was not ready for democracy, that only strong authority could prevent chaos \u2014 and was this a betrayal of his ideals or a realistic assessment of post-colonial politics?"

        "Why is Bol\u00edvar's legacy contested \u2014 celebrated as the George Washington of South America by some, criticized as a failed dictator who left behind weak states and caudillo (strongman) politics by others \u2014 and does the verdict depend on whether you judge his intentions or his results?",
        "What did Bol\u00edvar accomplish \u2014 liberating the territory of six modern nations (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Panama), ending 300 years of Spanish rule, and inspiring independence movements worldwide \u2014 and why was this not enough to fulfill his vision?",
        "How does Bol\u00edvar compare to other revolutionary leaders \u2014 Washington, who built a durable republic; Napoleon, who crowned himself emperor; San Mart\u00edn, who quietly retired \u2014 and what distinguishes the Bolivarian model of liberation?",
        "Why does Bol\u00edvar's warning about the United States \u2014 'the United States appears to be destined by Providence to plague America with misery in the name of liberty' \u2014 resonate so powerfully in Latin America two centuries later?"
