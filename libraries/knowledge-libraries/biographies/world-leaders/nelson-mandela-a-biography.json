        "Who was the young Nelson Mandela — born Rolihlahla Mandela in the Transkei, the son of a Thembu chief, given the name 'Nelson' by a schoolteacher — and how did his royal lineage, mission school education, and exposure to both traditional African and Western values shape his sense of justice?",
        "How did Mandela's years at the University of Fort Hare (1939-1940) and the University of the Witwatersrand — where he was one of a handful of Black law students — expose him to the full apparatus of racial discrimination and introduce him to the diverse activists who would become his lifelong comrades?",
        "What was apartheid's predecessor — the system of racial segregation already entrenched in South African law through the Native Land Act (1913), pass laws, and residential segregation — that Mandela was born into?",
        "How did Mandela's move to Johannesburg in 1941 — where he worked in a law firm, witnessed the poverty of Black townships, and joined the African National Congress — transform a rural chief's son into an urban political activist?",
        "What drew Mandela to the ANC Youth League (founded 1944) — the impatience with the ANC's polite petitioning of the white government, the demand for mass action, the influence of Anton Lembede's Africanism — and how did this youthful radicalism reshape the independence movement?"

      "name": "Fighting Apartheid: From Defiance to Armed Struggle (1948-1962)",
      "topics": [
        "What was apartheid — the system of racial classification, forced separation, and white supremacy that the National Party imposed after 1948 — and how did it differ from the segregation that preceded it in its systematic, legalized, and totalizing character?",
        "How did the Defiance Campaign of 1952 — in which 8,500 volunteers, including Mandela, deliberately violated apartheid laws and accepted arrest — establish mass civil disobedience as the ANC's strategy and make Mandela a national figure?",
        "What was the Freedom Charter (1955) — adopted at the Congress of the People in Kliptown — and why did its vision of a non-racial, democratic South Africa with shared wealth become both the ANC's founding document and the basis for treason charges against Mandela and 155 others?",
        "How did the Sharpeville Massacre (March 21, 1960) — where police shot dead 69 unarmed protesters, many shot in the back — convince Mandela that nonviolent resistance alone could not end apartheid?",
        "Why did Mandela co-found Umkhonto we Sizwe ('Spear of the Nation,' MK) in 1961 — turning from nonviolence to sabotage of government infrastructure — and how did he justify this shift while maintaining that the ANC's goal was not terrorism but liberation?"

      "topics": [
        "What was the Rivonia Trial (1963-1964) — where Mandela and nine co-defendants faced the death penalty for sabotage — and why did Mandela's statement from the dock ('an ideal for which I am prepared to die') become one of the most famous speeches of the 20th century?",
        "What was life on Robben Island — hard labor in a lime quarry, a cell measuring 6 by 8 feet, limited visits and letters, censored reading material — and how did Mandela and his fellow prisoners transform the prison into what they called 'the University'?",
        "How did Mandela maintain his political relevance during 27 years of imprisonment — through smuggled communications, the 'Free Mandela' international campaign, and his growing status as the world's most famous political prisoner?",
        "What happened inside Mandela during his decades in prison — the evolution from angry young revolutionary to strategic elder statesman, the cultivation of patience and long-term thinking, the decision to learn Afrikaans and study his enemy — and how did imprisonment transform him?",
        "How did the global anti-apartheid movement — economic sanctions, cultural boycotts, divestment campaigns, and growing international isolation — increase pressure on the South African government to negotiate?"

      "topics": [
        "Why did F.W. de Klerk release Mandela on February 11, 1990 — unbanning the ANC, the Communist Party, and other organizations — and was this an act of moral courage or a calculation that white minority rule was no longer sustainable?",
        "How did Mandela navigate the negotiations (1990-1993) — balancing pressure from ANC radicals who wanted revolution, white conservatives who feared Black majority rule, Inkatha violence in the townships, and his own commitment to a peaceful transition?",
        "What was the role of violence during the transition — the Boipatong massacre (1992), the assassination of Chris Hani (1993), threats of right-wing coups — and how close did South Africa come to civil war?",
        "How did Mandela and de Klerk share the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 — two men who profoundly distrusted each other but recognized that only negotiation could prevent catastrophe — and what did their partnership reveal about the difference between personal relationships and political necessities?",
        "What happened on April 27, 1994 — South Africa's first democratic election, with Black South Africans voting for the first time, queues stretching for miles — and why does this remain one of the most hopeful days in modern history?"

      "topics": [
        "How did Mandela govern as South Africa's first Black president — a Government of National Unity including former apartheid officials, a commitment to reconciliation over retribution, and the challenge of meeting enormous expectations with limited resources?",
        "What was the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (1996-1998) — chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, offering amnesty to those who confessed political crimes — and did this unprecedented experiment in transitional justice achieve reconciliation or let perpetrators escape accountability?",
        "How did Mandela address the economic legacy of apartheid — inheriting a country where white South Africans owned 87% of the land, controlled the economy, and enjoyed First World living standards while Black South Africans lived in poverty — and why did economic transformation prove harder than political transformation?",
        "What symbolic acts defined Mandela's presidency — wearing the Springbok jersey at the 1995 Rugby World Cup, visiting Betsie Verwoerd (the widow of the architect of apartheid), retaining white civil servants — and how did these gestures of reconciliation shape the new South Africa?",
        "Why did Mandela serve only one term (1994-1999) — voluntarily stepping down when he could easily have won re-election — and why was this decision, in a continent of presidents-for-life, perhaps his most important act of leadership?"

      "topics": [
        "How has Mandela been mythologized — the 'Mandela magic,' the saint-like public image, the global icon of reconciliation — and what does this sanitized version obscure about the real man, his political compromises, and his human flaws?",
        "What are the criticisms of Mandela's legacy — that he prioritized reconciliation over economic justice, that the ANC's corruption began on his watch, that inequality in South Africa has worsened since 1994, that the 'rainbow nation' was a beautiful idea that didn't survive contact with reality?",
        "How did Mandela's approach to HIV/AIDS — his initial reluctance to address the epidemic, followed by his extraordinary public advocacy after leaving office, including disclosing that his son died of AIDS — reflect both the limits and the evolution of his leadership?",
        "What does Mandela's life teach about political forgiveness — the extraordinary decision not to seek revenge after 27 years of imprisonment — and is this replicable, or was it a function of one exceptional individual's character?",
        "Why did Mandela become, in the phrase of his biographer Anthony Sampson, 'the world's most admired man' — and what does the global hunger for a Mandela-like figure reveal about the shortage of moral leadership in the 21st century?"
