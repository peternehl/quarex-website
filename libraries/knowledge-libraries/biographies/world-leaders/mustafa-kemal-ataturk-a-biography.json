        "Who was the young Mustafa Kemal \u2014 born in Ottoman Salonica (modern Thessaloniki), the son of a minor customs official, educated at military academies where he excelled \u2014 and how did the declining Ottoman Empire shape a generation of young officers determined to modernize or die?",
        "How did Kemal's early military career \u2014 fighting in Libya against the Italians (1911), the Balkan Wars (1912-1913), and internal Ottoman power struggles \u2014 hone both his military skills and his contempt for the sultanate's incompetence?",
        "What was Kemal's role at Gallipoli (1915) \u2014 commanding the defense of the Chunuk Bair heights, famously telling his troops 'I don't order you to attack, I order you to die' \u2014 and how did this victory against the British and ANZAC forces make him a national hero?",
        "How did World War I destroy the Ottoman Empire \u2014 catastrophic defeats, the Armenian Genocide (1915-1923), the British capture of Mesopotamia and Palestine, and the armistice that left Anatolia itself subject to partition \u2014 while Kemal watched from the Eastern Front?",
        "What was the Treaty of S\u00e8vres (1920) \u2014 which proposed to carve up Anatolia among Greece, France, Italy, Armenia, and Kurdistan, leaving Turkey a rump state \u2014 and why did this 'death sentence' galvanize Turkish resistance under Kemal's leadership?"

        "What was the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922) \u2014 Greek forces advancing deep into Anatolia, Kemal's counteroffensive at the Battle of Saky\u00e1rya (1921) and the Battle of Dumlup\u0131nar (1922), and the recapture of Smyrna (modern Izmir) \u2014 and how did this victory secure Turkish sovereignty?",
        "What was the Great Fire of Smyrna (September 1922) \u2014 the destruction of the Greek and Armenian quarters as Turkish forces retook the city, with estimates of 10,000-100,000 killed \u2014 and how does this event remain bitterly contested between Turkish and Greek national narratives?",
        "How did the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) \u2014 replacing S\u00e8vres, recognizing Turkish sovereignty over Anatolia and Eastern Thrace \u2014 represent Kemal's greatest diplomatic achievement and the only successful renegotiation of a post-World War I treaty?",
        "What was the population exchange of 1923 \u2014 1.5 million Greeks expelled from Turkey and 500,000 Turks expelled from Greece \u2014 and how did this forced migration, endorsed by the international community, establish a precedent for ethnic cleansing as state policy?"

        "How did Atat\u00fcrk proclaim the Turkish Republic on October 29, 1923 \u2014 abolishing the sultanate, establishing Ankara as the capital, and declaring that sovereignty belonged to the nation rather than a dynasty \u2014 in the most radical political transformation of the post-war period?",
        "What was the abolition of the caliphate (March 1924) \u2014 ending 13 centuries of Islamic institutional authority, expelling the caliph, and declaring Turkey a secular state \u2014 and why did this decision shock the Muslim world while establishing the principle of Turkish secularism (laiklik)?",
        "How did Atat\u00fcrk's legal reforms transform Turkish society \u2014 replacing Islamic sharia law with the Swiss civil code, the Italian penal code, and the German commercial code \u2014 effectively importing an entire Western legal framework in a single generation?",
        "What was the Hat Law of 1925 \u2014 banning the fez and requiring Western-style hats, enforced with arrests and even executions \u2014 and why did Atat\u00fcrk consider dress reform essential, saying 'the civilized international dress is worthy and appropriate for our nation'?",
        "How did Atat\u00fcrk's alphabet revolution of 1928 \u2014 replacing the Arabic script with a Latin alphabet in just three months \u2014 simultaneously modernize communication, cut Turkey off from its Ottoman literary heritage, and make the population functionally illiterate overnight?"

        "What role did education play in the Kemalist project \u2014 making primary education compulsory and co-educational, opening hundreds of schools, sending students abroad, and requiring the teaching of science rather than religion \u2014 in transforming an overwhelmingly rural, illiterate population?",
        "How did Atat\u00fcrk define Turkish secularism (laiklik) \u2014 not the French model of keeping religion out of public life, but state control OF religion through the Directorate of Religious Affairs \u2014 and why has this model generated ongoing tension between secular and religious Turks?",
        "What were Atat\u00fcrk's 'Six Arrows' \u2014 republicanism, populism, nationalism, secularism, statism, and reformism \u2014 and how did these principles, embedded in the constitution and enforced by the military, define Turkish political life for nearly a century?",
        "How did Atat\u00fcrk handle opposition \u2014 suppressing Kurdish revolts (Sheikh Said rebellion, 1925; Dersim massacre, 1937-1938), banning opposition parties, controlling the press, and executing opponents \u2014 while presenting himself as a democratic reformer?"

        "Why was Atat\u00fcrk given the surname meaning 'Father of the Turks' (1934) \u2014 a name that no other Turk may legally use \u2014 and how has his cult of personality, enforced by law (it is a crime to insult his memory), shaped Turkish political culture?",
        "How has Erdo\u011fan's Turkey challenged the Kemalist legacy \u2014 rolling back secularism, empowering political Islam, and rewriting the relationship between state and religion that Atat\u00fcrk established \u2014 while still invoking Atat\u00fcrk's name?",
        "What is Atat\u00fcrk's global legacy \u2014 the model of a military-led secular modernization that inspired leaders from Nasser to the Shah to Nehru \u2014 and why has this model largely failed elsewhere while Turkey's own version is under threat?",
        "How does Atat\u00fcrk's treatment of minorities \u2014 the Armenian Genocide denial, the Kurdish suppression, the Greek population exchange \u2014 complicate the narrative of the progressive nation-builder, and can his achievements be separated from these crimes?"
