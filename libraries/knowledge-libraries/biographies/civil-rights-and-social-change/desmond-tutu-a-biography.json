      "topics": [
        "Who was Desmond Mpilo Tutu — born in Klerksdorp, South Africa, the son of a schoolteacher, originally trained as a teacher himself before the Bantu Education Act (1953) made teaching in a system designed to produce servility intolerable — and how did he find his calling in the Anglican priesthood?",
        "How did Tutu's years studying theology in London (1962-1966) — experiencing life without racial classification for the first time — radicalize his understanding of what apartheid had stolen from Black South Africans?",
        "What was Tutu's role as General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches (1978-1985) — using the institutional platform of the church to challenge apartheid, support political detainees' families, and speak to the world when political leaders were imprisoned or silenced?",
        "How did Tutu become the international voice of anti-apartheid — his eloquent English, his Anglican collar that commanded respect in Western capitals, his insistence on nonviolence, and his willingness to confront both the apartheid government and the violence within the liberation movement?",
        "Why did Tutu win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 — for his 'role as a unifying leader figure in the nonviolent campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid' — and how did the prize protect him from the government's worst reprisals while amplifying his message?"

      "name": "Archbishop Against Apartheid (1986-1990)",
      "topics": [
        "How did Tutu use his position as Archbishop of Cape Town (1986-1996) — the head of the Anglican Church in Southern Africa, the first Black person to hold the position — to challenge apartheid with moral authority that the state could not silence?",
        "What was Tutu's role in preventing violence — physically inserting himself between mobs and their victims, stopping the 'necklacing' (execution by burning tire) of a suspected informer, demanding nonviolence from a community with every reason for rage?",
        "How did Tutu's theology of ubuntu — 'I am because we are,' the African concept that human identity is formed through relationship and community — provide a moral framework for opposing apartheid that transcended Western liberal individualism?",
        "What was Tutu's relationship with the ANC — supporting their goals while criticizing their methods when they used violence, maintaining independence from any political party, insisting that the church's loyalty was to justice rather than to any movement?",
        "How did Tutu's call for international sanctions — economic boycotts, divestment from South African companies, cultural and sporting isolation — contribute to the pressure that eventually forced the apartheid government to negotiate, and how did he respond to critics who said sanctions hurt Black workers most?"

      "name": "Liberation and the Truth Commission (1990-1998)",
      "topics": [
        "How did Tutu react to the release of Nelson Mandela on February 11, 1990 — dancing in the streets, leading crowds in celebration — and what role did he play in the transition from apartheid to democracy during the fraught negotiations of 1990-1994?",
        "What was the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC, 1996-1998) — which Tutu chaired — and how did its model of truth-telling over prosecution attempt to heal a nation without the retributive justice that victims often demanded?",
        "How did the TRC work — victims testifying publicly about what was done to them, perpetrators applying for amnesty by fully confessing politically motivated crimes — and why did Tutu insist that truth was a prerequisite for reconciliation even when forgiveness seemed impossible?",
        "How did Tutu react to the testimony — weeping publicly as victims described torture, rape, and murder by security forces, insisting that the commissioners hear every account with full humanity — and what did his emotional openness accomplish that a more detached judicial process could not?",
        "What were the TRC's limitations — perpetrators who refused to apply for amnesty, victims who felt justice was denied, the ANC's resistance to scrutiny of its own abuses — and has the commission's model of restorative justice been vindicated or discredited by South Africa's subsequent history?"

      "name": "The Moral Voice: Post-Apartheid Criticism (1999-2021)",
      "topics": [
        "Why did Tutu criticize the ANC government after apartheid — calling out corruption under Thabo Mbeki, attacking Mbeki's AIDS denialism (which cost an estimated 330,000 lives), warning that the liberation movement was betraying its own values — and how did the party respond?",
        "How did Tutu challenge Jacob Zuma — calling the president's corruption 'worse than apartheid' in some respects, warning that South Africa was becoming a one-party state — and what did it cost him to oppose the very movement he had supported for decades?",
        "How did Tutu become a global moral voice beyond South Africa — speaking against the Iraq War, criticizing Israeli occupation of Palestine (drawing accusations of anti-Semitism), advocating for climate justice, and supporting LGBTQ+ rights (breaking with most African churches)?",
        "Why was Tutu's support for LGBTQ+ rights particularly courageous — in an African context where homosexuality is widely criminalized and religious leaders overwhelmingly oppose it — and what did he mean by saying 'I would not worship a God who is homophobic'?",
        "How did Tutu's concept of the 'Rainbow Nation' — the term he coined for post-apartheid South Africa — hold up against the reality of persistent inequality, land dispossession, and the failure of economic transformation for most Black South Africans?"

        "How did Tutu die on December 26, 2021 — at age 90, in Cape Town, given the modest funeral he requested (a plain pine coffin, no flowers, his body aquamated rather than cremated to minimize environmental impact) — and why did the outpouring of grief span continents?",
        "What is Tutu's theological legacy — the demonstration that Christianity can be a force for liberation rather than oppression, that ubuntu offers an alternative to Western individualism, and that prophetic witness (speaking truth to power regardless of consequences) is the church's highest calling?",
        "How does the TRC model compare to other transitional justice approaches — Nuremberg-style trials (Germany, Rwanda), truth commissions without amnesty (Chile, Argentina), blanket amnesty (Spain) — and has Tutu's approach influenced post-conflict societies worldwide?",
        "What did Tutu mean when he said 'if you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor' — and why does this principle challenge comfortable people in every country, not just apartheid South Africa?",
        "What is Tutu's enduring significance — the demonstration that moral authority grounded in faith and practiced with courage, humor, and compassion can challenge the most entrenched systems of injustice — and what does the world lose when such voices fall silent?"
