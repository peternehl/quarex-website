        "Who is Malala Yousafzai — born in Mingora, the Swat Valley of Pakistan, in 1997, the daughter of school principal Ziauddin Yousafzai who named her after Malalai of Maiwand, a Pashtun heroine — and how did her father's commitment to girls' education make the family a target of the Taliban?",
        "What happened to the Swat Valley — once called 'the Switzerland of Pakistan,' a tourist destination known for its natural beauty — when the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) seized control in 2007, destroying over 400 schools, banning girls' education, and imposing brutal enforcement of their version of sharia law?",
        "How did 11-year-old Malala begin writing a blog for BBC Urdu in January 2009 — under the pseudonym 'Gul Makai,' describing life under Taliban rule, her fear of going to school, the sound of bombs — becoming a voice for millions of Pakistani girls denied education?",
        "What was the military operation to retake Swat (2009) — the Pakistani Army's offensive displacing 2 million people, including Malala's family — and how did the return reveal that the Taliban's destruction of schools and culture had left scars that military victory could not heal?",
        "What role did Malala's father play — running his school despite Taliban threats, refusing to close the girls' section, speaking publicly against the Taliban, raising a daughter who believed education was worth dying for — and why is his courage inseparable from hers?"

      "name": "The Shooting (October 9, 2012)",
      "topics": [
        "How did Malala become increasingly public — appearing on Pakistani television, receiving Pakistan's National Youth Peace Prize (2011), speaking to international media, a New York Times documentary following her life — and why did this visibility make her a marked target?",
        "What happened on October 9, 2012 — a Taliban gunman boarding Malala's school bus, asking 'who is Malala?', and shooting her in the head at point-blank range, also wounding classmates Kainat Riaz and Shazia Ramzan — in an attack ordered by TTP leader Maulana Fazlullah?",
        "How did Malala survive — emergency surgery in Peshawar to remove the bullet from her skull, airlifted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, multiple reconstructive surgeries over months, permanent hearing loss in one ear — and what mobilized the international medical response?",
        "How did the Taliban justify shooting a child — claiming she was 'promoting Western culture in Pashtun areas,' threatening to target her again — and why did the attack provoke worldwide condemnation including from Pakistani religious leaders, military officials, and the general public?",
        "What was the 'Malala moment' in Pakistan — millions rallying behind her, a national conversation about education and extremism, the Pakistani government finally launching military operations against the TTP in North Waziristan — and did this moment produce lasting change or fade with the news cycle?"

      "topics": [
        "How did Malala recover in Birmingham — learning to walk again, regaining speech, attending school in England, her family relocating permanently — and what was it like for a Pakistani teenager to become the world's most famous advocate for education while living in exile?",
        "What was Malala's speech at the United Nations (July 12, 2013, her 16th birthday) — 'one child, one teacher, one book, and one pen can change the world' — establishing her as a global advocate for the 130 million girls worldwide denied access to school?",
        "How did 'I Am Malala' (2013) — her autobiography co-written with Christina Lamb — become a global bestseller, reaching audiences who had never thought about Pakistan, the Taliban, or girls' education, and making her story one of the most-read memoirs of the decade?",
        "Why did Malala win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 at age 17 — the youngest laureate in history, sharing the prize with Indian children's rights activist Kailash Satyarthi — and what did this recognition accomplish beyond symbolism?",
        "How did Malala handle being a teenager under global scrutiny — navigating school exams alongside UN speeches, dealing with both adulation and criticism, maintaining her sense of humor — and what does her normality amid extraordinary circumstances reveal about resilience?"

      "name": "The Malala Fund and the Fight for Education",
      "topics": [
        "What has the Malala Fund achieved since 2013 — investing in education programs in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Lebanon, and other countries, funding local advocates (called 'Education Champions'), publishing research on barriers to girls' education, advocating for 12 years of free education for every girl?",
        "How does the Fund work differently from traditional NGOs — investing in local women leaders rather than imposing Western solutions, focusing on advocacy and policy change rather than building schools, understanding that barriers to girls' education are political and cultural, not just economic?",
        "What happened when the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan (August 2021) — banning girls' secondary education, closing universities to women — and how did this reversal challenge everything Malala had fought for, demonstrating that progress is never permanent?",
        "How has Malala navigated criticism — from Pakistanis who see her as a Western puppet, from those who question why one girl receives so much attention when millions suffer silently, from those who note that her advocacy has not prevented the Taliban's return — and how does she respond?",
        "What did Malala's graduation from Oxford (2020, Philosophy, Politics, and Economics) represent — the girl the Taliban shot for wanting an education completing one of the world's most prestigious degrees — and how does she balance being both a symbol and a person?"

      "topics": [
        "What is Malala's significance for the global education movement — putting girls' education on the international agenda, demonstrating that children can be powerful advocates, connecting education to security (extremism thrives where schools fail)?",
        "How does Malala's story challenge the narrative of the 'helpless Muslim woman' — she is Pakistani, Pashtun, Muslim, and fierce, drawing her courage from her faith and culture rather than rejecting them — and why is this complexity important in an era of Islamophobia?",
        "What does Malala's story teach about the power and limits of individual activism — that one person's courage can inspire millions, but that structural change requires institutions, funding, political will, and the kind of patient organizing that doesn't make headlines?",
        "How does Malala's experience connect to the broader fight for women's rights — from Afghanistan to Nigeria to the American debate over book bans and curriculum restrictions — and why is access to education the foundation of every other freedom?",
        "Why did Malala say 'they thought that the bullet would silence us, but they failed' — and what does her life, from a school bus in Swat to the Nobel stage in Oslo to Oxford's dreaming spires, teach about the relationship between education, courage, and the refusal to be silenced?"
