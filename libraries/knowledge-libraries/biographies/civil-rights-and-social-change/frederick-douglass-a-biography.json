      "name": "Slavery: The World He Was Born Into (1818-1838)",
      "topics": [
        "What was Frederick Douglass born into — enslaved as Frederick Bailey on Maryland's Eastern Shore around 1818, never knowing his exact birthday, separated from his mother as an infant, likely the son of his white enslaver — and how did the systematic dehumanization of slavery shape everything that followed?",
        "How did Douglass learn to read — taught the alphabet by Sophia Auld in Baltimore, then self-educating after her husband forbade it ('if you teach that nigger to read, there will be no keeping him') — and why did Douglass later call literacy 'the pathway from slavery to freedom'?",
        "What was the turning point of Douglass's enslavement — his fight with the slave-breaker Edward Covey in 1834, when Douglass physically resisted a beating for the first time — and why did he describe this moment as his resurrection from the 'dark night of slavery'?",
        "How did Douglass escape slavery in September 1838 — disguised as a free Black sailor, carrying borrowed identification papers, traveling by train and ferry from Baltimore to New York — in a journey that took less than 24 hours but risked his life?",
        "What was the institution of American slavery that Douglass experienced and later described — not merely forced labor but a total system of physical violence, sexual exploitation, family destruction, psychological control, and legal non-personhood?"

      "name": "The Abolitionist Orator (1838-1860)",
      "topics": [
        "How did Douglass become the most powerful voice against slavery in America — discovered by the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society in 1841, his first speech at a Nantucket convention leaving the audience stunned by the eloquence of a man who had been property three years earlier?",
        "What was the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass (1845) — his autobiography, published at enormous personal risk (it revealed his identity and location to his former enslaver) — and why did it become the most influential slave narrative ever written?",
        "How did Douglass's relationship with William Lloyd Garrison evolve — initially his mentor and sponsor, later a bitter rival when Douglass rejected Garrison's view that the Constitution was a pro-slavery document and that moral persuasion alone could end slavery?",
        "What was Douglass's 'What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?' speech (July 5, 1852) — perhaps the greatest American speech of the 19th century, arguing that the nation's celebration of liberty was 'mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy' to those still enslaved?",
        "How did Douglass use his newspaper, The North Star (founded 1847) — and later Frederick Douglass' Paper — as platforms for abolitionism, women's rights, and political engagement, demonstrating that a formerly enslaved person could command intellectual authority in American public life?"

      "name": "The Civil War and Emancipation (1860-1865)",
      "topics": [
        "What was Douglass's relationship with John Brown — he admired Brown's moral courage but refused to join the raid on Harpers Ferry (1859), believing it would fail — and how did Brown's execution galvanize the abolitionist cause?",
        "How did Douglass push Abraham Lincoln toward emancipation — through public speeches, newspaper editorials, and personal meetings at the White House — and why did Douglass describe Lincoln as 'the white man's president' even while recognizing his historical importance?",
        "What was Douglass's role in recruiting Black soldiers for the Union Army — his 'Men of Color, To Arms!' editorial (1863), his successful recruitment for the 54th Massachusetts Infantry — and why did he believe that Black military service would prove the case for citizenship?",
        "How did the Emancipation Proclamation (January 1, 1863) and the 13th Amendment (1865) fulfill what Douglass had fought for — and why did he immediately recognize that legal freedom without economic resources, political rights, and social equality would be freedom in name only?",
        "What did the Civil War cost — 750,000 dead, the destruction of the Southern economy, 4 million people freed from slavery — and how did Douglass assess the meaning of this catastrophe?"

      "name": "Reconstruction, Betrayal, and the Long Fight (1865-1895)",
      "topics": [
        "How did Douglass fight for Black voting rights during Reconstruction — supporting the 14th and 15th Amendments, serving as a link between the Republican Party and Black communities — while also supporting women's suffrage despite the painful split with former allies like Elizabeth Cady Stanton?",
        "What was the betrayal of Reconstruction — the Compromise of 1877, the withdrawal of federal troops, the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, the imposition of Jim Crow — and how did Douglass watch the rights he had fought for systematically dismantled?",
        "How did Douglass serve in government — as marshal and recorder of deeds for Washington, D.C., and as minister to Haiti — becoming the most prominent Black political figure in America while facing criticism that he had become too accommodating to white power?",
        "What was Douglass's position on lynching — the epidemic of racial terror that killed an estimated 4,400 Black Americans between 1877 and 1950 — and why did his final great speech, 'The Lessons of the Hour' (1894), focus on this systematic violence?",
        "How did Douglass die on February 20, 1895 — collapsing after attending a women's rights meeting, active until his final day — and what had he accomplished in a life that spanned from slavery to the halls of power?"

      "name": "Legacy: The Prophet of American Democracy",
      "topics": [
        "Why is Douglass considered the greatest African American leader of the 19th century — escaping slavery, mastering the language of his oppressors, shaping the debate that ended slavery, and insisting that American democracy could not exist without racial justice?",
        "How did Douglass's three autobiographies — Narrative (1845), My Bondage and My Freedom (1855), and Life and Times (1881/1892) — create the template for African American autobiography and establish the slave narrative as a major literary genre?",
        "What was Douglass's theory of social change — that power concedes nothing without a demand, that moral argument must be backed by political action, and that the oppressed must speak for themselves rather than relying on white allies — and how does it compare to later approaches?",
        "How does Douglass remain relevant — his analysis of how racism operates through law, economics, and culture; his insistence that the Constitution, properly interpreted, demands equality; his understanding that freedom without resources is hollow — speaking directly to 21st-century debates?",
        "What would Douglass say about America today — mass incarceration, voter suppression, economic inequality, the persistence of racial hierarchy — and does his faith in the promise of American democracy survive the evidence of American history?"
