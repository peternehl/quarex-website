        "Who was Emmeline Pankhurst — born Emmeline Goulden in Manchester to politically active parents, married to barrister Richard Pankhurst (a supporter of women's suffrage), mother of five — and how did decades of polite campaigning for women's rights, met with mockery and indifference, convince her that militancy was the only path forward?",
        "What were women's legal rights in Victorian Britain — unable to vote, excluded from most professions, property passing to husbands upon marriage, limited custody rights, legal tolerance of domestic violence — and why had 50 years of peaceful suffrage campaigns produced nothing?",
        "How did the death of Pankhurst's husband Richard in 1898 — leaving her in financial difficulty with five children — force her into the workforce as a registrar of births and deaths, where she witnessed firsthand the poverty, abuse, and powerlessness of women without political representation?",
        "Why did Pankhurst found the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1903 — with the motto 'Deeds Not Words' — breaking from the patient constitutionalism of Millicent Fawcett's suffragists to demand immediate action?",
        "What was the political context — a Liberal Party that promised suffrage and repeatedly broke its promises, a Parliament that laughed at women's petitions, a press that ignored peaceful demonstrations — that made Pankhurst conclude 'the argument of the broken pane of glass is the most valuable argument in modern politics'?"

      "name": "Deeds Not Words: The Suffragette Campaign (1903-1910)",
      "topics": [
        "How did the suffragette campaign begin — Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney heckling a Liberal Party meeting in 1905, deliberately getting arrested to generate publicity — establishing the WSPU's strategy of provoking the state into overreaction?",
        "What tactics did the early WSPU use — heckling politicians, chaining themselves to railings, rushing Parliament, disrupting public events, organizing mass marches — and why were these nonviolent but confrontational tactics effective at getting press attention that decades of petitioning had failed to achieve?",
        "How did the British government respond — arresting suffragettes, imprisoning them as common criminals rather than political prisoners, force-feeding hunger strikers through nasal tubes — and why did this state violence against women generate the public sympathy the movement needed?",
        "What was the 'rush' on Parliament (October 13, 1908) — thousands of suffragettes attempting to enter the House of Commons, 37 arrested, Pankhurst herself tried and imprisoned — and how did these mass actions demonstrate that the movement had grown beyond a small group of radicals?",
        "How did the WSPU's organizational structure work — Pankhurst and Christabel running it as an autocracy, expelling members who disagreed, demanding absolute loyalty — and why did this undemocratic structure within a democratic movement create tensions that would eventually split the family?"

      "topics": [
        "What was 'Black Friday' (November 18, 1910) — suffragettes marching to Parliament assaulted and sexually molested by police and bystanders for six hours, two women dying from injuries — and why did this event convince Pankhurst that property destruction was justified to protect women's bodies?",
        "How did the campaign escalate — from window-smashing (1912) to cutting telegraph wires, slashing paintings in galleries, bombing empty buildings, setting fire to letterboxes and churches — and why did Pankhurst consider this destruction justified: 'the only reckless thing the women have done is to risk their own lives'?",
        "What was the Cat and Mouse Act (1913) — the government's response to hunger-striking prisoners, releasing them when weakened then re-arresting them when recovered, avoiding the martyrdom of women dying in prison — and how did Pankhurst endure multiple cycles of imprisonment, starvation, and release?",
        "How did the death of Emily Davison — who stepped in front of the King's horse at the Epsom Derby on June 4, 1913, dying four days later — become the most dramatic moment of the suffrage campaign, and was it deliberate martyrdom or a protest gone wrong?",
        "What was the relationship between Pankhurst and her daughters — Christabel as her political partner, Sylvia breaking away over the WSPU's abandonment of working-class women and alliance with the establishment, Adela sent to Australia after disagreements — and what do these family ruptures reveal about the costs of radical leadership?"

      "name": "War, Victory, and Transformation (1914-1928)",
      "topics": [
        "How did World War I change everything — Pankhurst immediately suspending the suffrage campaign, urging women to support the war effort, demanding the right to serve — and was this patriotic pivot a betrayal of the movement or a strategic masterstroke?",
        "How did women's wartime service transform the debate — women running factories, driving ambulances, farming the land, proving their capability beyond any argument — and did the vote come because of suffragette militancy, wartime contribution, or both?",
        "What did the Representation of the People Act (1918) achieve — giving the vote to women over 30 who met property qualifications (about 8.4 million women), while men could vote at 21 with no property requirement — and why was this partial victory both triumph and insult?",
        "How did Pankhurst's politics shift in later life — from socialist radical to Conservative Party candidate, from suffragette to anti-Bolshevik, from demanding women's liberation to supporting the British Empire — and what does this evolution reveal about the relationship between single-issue activism and broader political ideology?",
        "How did Pankhurst die on June 14, 1928 — just weeks before the Equal Franchise Act gave all women the vote on the same terms as men — achieving the goal she had fought for for 25 years, just too late to see it?"

        "What is Pankhurst's place in history — named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century, a statue unveiled outside Parliament in 2018, the founder of a movement that won women the vote in Britain and inspired suffrage movements worldwide?",
        "How does the suffragette/suffragist debate persist — Fawcett's constitutionalists arguing that peaceful campaigning was winning; Pankhurst's militants arguing that violence was necessary to force the issue — and which strategy actually secured the vote?",
        "What did Pankhurst's movement contribute beyond the vote — the demonstration that women could organize, fight, endure imprisonment, and force political change; the creation of a feminist political tradition; the proof that 'patience' in the face of injustice is not always a virtue?",
        "How does Pankhurst's legacy inform contemporary activism — the debate over property destruction versus peaceful protest, the suffragettes invoked by climate activists (Extinction Rebellion), the question of whether movements must make people uncomfortable to succeed?",
        "Why did Pankhurst say 'we are here not because we are law-breakers; we are here in our efforts to become law-makers' — and what does her life teach about the relationship between justice, law, and the willingness to break one to achieve the other?"
