        "Who was Charlie Chaplin — born in a London workhouse in 1889, raised in crushing poverty, his mother institutionalized with psychosis, his father an alcoholic who died at 37, performing in music halls as a child — and how did this Dickensian childhood produce the most beloved performer of the 20th century?",
        "How did Chaplin make it to America — joining Fred Karno's music hall troupe (alongside Stan Laurel), touring the US in 1910 and 1912, spotted by Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios — and how did the transition from stage to screen reveal a performer who understood the camera instinctively?",
        "How did Chaplin create the Tramp — the bowler hat, the cane, the too-tight coat, the too-big shoes, the mustache, the waddle — a character who first appeared in 1914 and became the most recognizable figure on Earth within two years?",
        "Why did the Tramp resonate so universally — a figure of dignity in the face of indignity, the little man against the machine, simultaneously pathetic and heroic — and how did Chaplin's own experience of poverty give the character its emotional authenticity?",
        "How did Chaplin's salary explode — from $150/week at Keystone (1914) to $670,000/year at Mutual (1916) to co-founding United Artists with Pickford, Fairbanks, and Griffith (1919) — making him the first performer to control his own creative and financial destiny?"

      "name": "Silent Masterpieces (1918-1931)",
      "topics": [
        "What did Chaplin achieve with 'The Kid' (1921) — a six-reel comedy about the Tramp raising an abandoned child, mixing slapstick with genuine pathos — and why did audiences weep at a comedy, proving that Chaplin could make people feel as powerfully as he made them laugh?",
        "How did 'The Gold Rush' (1925) blend physical comedy with existential loneliness — the dance of the dinner rolls, the shoe-eating scene, the Tramp alone on New Year's Eve — and why did Chaplin call it 'the picture I want to be remembered by'?",
        "What made 'City Lights' (1931) the supreme achievement of silent comedy — the Tramp falling in love with a blind flower girl, the millionaire who befriends him when drunk and forgets him when sober, the devastating final shot — and why did Chaplin resist sound to make it?",
        "How did Chaplin work — filming without a script, shooting 50 takes of a single gag, spending years on a feature, composing the music himself, controlling every aspect of production — with a perfectionism that made his output tiny but his influence enormous?",
        "Why did Chaplin resist the transition to sound — releasing 'City Lights' and 'Modern Times' as essentially silent films years after 'The Jazz Singer' (1927) — and was this artistic courage, commercial stubbornness, or fear that his voice would betray the Tramp's universality?"

      "name": "The Great Dictator and the Politics of Comedy (1931-1947)",
      "topics": [
        "How did 'Modern Times' (1936) satirize industrial capitalism — the Tramp swallowed by factory gears, driven mad by the assembly line, arrested for accidentally leading a communist march — and why is this Depression-era comedy about automation more relevant now than when it was made?",
        "How did 'The Great Dictator' (1940) — Chaplin's first true talking picture, a satire of Hitler and Mussolini released while America was still neutral — demonstrate that comedy could be a weapon against fascism?",
        "Why did Chaplin end 'The Great Dictator' with a six-minute direct-address speech — breaking character, breaking the fourth wall, calling for human kindness and against tyranny — and why has this speech been shared more widely in the internet age than any other moment in cinema?",
        "How did 'Monsieur Verdoux' (1947) — a dark comedy about a bank clerk who murders wealthy widows, based on a story idea from Orson Welles — reveal Chaplin's growing cynicism, arguing that one man's murders are nothing compared to the mass killing of war?",
        "What was Chaplin's political evolution — from the Tramp's instinctive sympathy for the underdog to explicit anti-fascism to postwar leftism — and why did his politics make him enemies in an America turning toward Cold War conservatism?"

      "name": "Exile and the Private Chaplin (1947-1977)",
      "topics": [
        "Why was Chaplin driven from America in 1952 — FBI surveillance under J. Edgar Hoover since the 1940s, accusations of Communist sympathies during McCarthyism, the Joan Barry paternity scandal, his refusal to become an American citizen — and how did the country that made him famous exile him for his beliefs?",
        "How did Chaplin's personal life fuel public hostility — marriages to teenage girls (Mildred Harris at 16, Lita Grey at 16), scandalous divorces, the Joan Barry paternity suit (blood tests proved he wasn't the father; the jury didn't care) — and where is the line between legitimate criticism and puritanical persecution?",
        "What was Chaplin's life in exile — settling in Vevey, Switzerland, with his fourth wife Oona O'Neill (Eugene O'Neill's daughter, 36 years his junior), raising eight children, making two more films ('A King in New York,' 'A Countess from Hong Kong')?",
        "How did 'A King in New York' (1957) — a satire of McCarthyism, consumerism, and American culture, made in Britain, never released in the US during Chaplin's lifetime — represent his revenge on the country that exiled him?",
        "What was Chaplin's relationship with Oona O'Neill — a marriage that lasted 34 years until his death, by all accounts happy and stable, her father Eugene O'Neill disowning her for marrying a man his age — and why was this his only successful relationship?"

      "topics": [
        "How did Chaplin return to America in 1972 — receiving an honorary Academy Award, the longest standing ovation in Oscar history (12 minutes), reconciliation with a country that had exiled him 20 years earlier — and why was this homecoming one of cinema's most emotional moments?",
        "How did Chaplin die on Christmas Day 1977 at age 88 — and why was his body stolen from its grave three months later by two men demanding a ransom from Oona, recovered 11 weeks later in a nearby cornfield?",
        "What is Chaplin's influence on comedy — from Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd to Jacques Tati, Woody Allen, Roberto Benigni, and Rowan Atkinson — and why has no comedian since achieved his combination of physical brilliance, emotional depth, and social commentary?",
        "How does Chaplin's artistic control compare to modern filmmaking — writing, directing, producing, starring in, and composing the music for his own films — and why has this level of authorship remained nearly impossible to replicate in the film industry?",
        "Why does the Tramp endure — recognized in every culture, his image on walls from Tokyo to São Paulo, the universal symbol of human dignity in the face of a world that doesn't care — and what did Chaplin understand about the human condition that made a silent clown immortal?"
