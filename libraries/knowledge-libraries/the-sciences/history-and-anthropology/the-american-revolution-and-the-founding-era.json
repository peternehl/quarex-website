        "How did the Stamp Act of 1765 unite thirteen colonies that had virtually nothing else in common — different economies, religions, and ethnic compositions — into a coordinated resistance movement?",
        "Why did 'no taxation without representation' become the revolution's rallying cry when British subjects in Manchester, Birmingham, and Sheffield also lacked parliamentary representation and never revolted?",
        "What happened at the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770, and how did Paul Revere's engraving — which depicted a disciplined British firing squad rather than the chaotic melee that actually occurred — become America's first viral propaganda?",
        "How did the Tea Act of 1773 actually lower the price of tea, and why did colonists destroy 342 chests of it anyway — was the Boston Tea Party about economics or about the principle of parliamentary authority?",
        "What were the Intolerable Acts (Coercive Acts) of 1774, and how did Parliament's attempt to punish Massachusetts instead convince the other twelve colonies that their liberties were next?",
        "Why did the First Continental Congress (September 1774) stop short of declaring independence, and what did the delegates hope petitions and boycotts would accomplish that armed resistance could not?"

        "What actually happened at Lexington Green on April 19, 1775 — who fired the 'shot heard round the world,' and why does it matter that nobody knows?",
        "How did the Battle of Bunker Hill (June 17, 1775) — technically a British victory that cost them 1,054 casualties out of 2,200 troops — convince both sides that this was going to be a real war?",
        "Why did it take fourteen months from Lexington to the Declaration of Independence, and what finally tipped the balance — Thomas Paine's Common Sense (January 1776) selling 500,000 copies in a population of 2.5 million?",
        "What did Thomas Jefferson actually write in the Declaration of Independence, what did Congress cut (including a passage condemning slavery), and why did John Adams predict the wrong date would be celebrated?",
        "How did the signers of the Declaration understand the personal risk — Benjamin Franklin's quip 'we must all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately' was not entirely a joke?",
        "Why did approximately one-third of colonists remain Loyalists throughout the war, and what happened to the estimated 60,000-80,000 who fled to Canada, Britain, and the Caribbean after independence?"

        "What was the strategic significance of the Battle of Saratoga (October 1777), where the American victory convinced France to enter the war with troops, ships, and money that proved decisive?",
        "How did Valley Forge (winter 1777-1778) transform from a symbol of American suffering into a military turning point — with Baron von Steuben drilling a ragged militia into a professional fighting force?",
        "Why was the war in the Southern colonies (1780-1781) — featuring guerrilla warfare by Francis Marion, brutal civil war between Patriots and Loyalists, and Cornwallis's costly victories — the campaign that ultimately ended the war?",
        "How did the French navy's victory at the Battle of the Chesapeake (September 1781) trap Cornwallis at Yorktown, making the decisive land siege possible — proving the war was won at sea as much as on land?",
        "What role did enslaved people play on both sides — from the 5,000 Black soldiers in the Continental Army to Lord Dunmore's proclamation offering freedom to slaves who joined the British?"

        "Why did the Articles of Confederation fail so completely — with Congress unable to tax, regulate trade, or enforce laws — that by 1787 even its supporters agreed the system was unworkable?",
        "What was the Great Compromise (Connecticut Compromise), and how did the creation of a bicameral legislature with proportional representation in the House and equal state representation in the Senate resolve the deadlock between large and small states?",
        "How did the Three-Fifths Compromise — counting enslaved people as three-fifths of a person for representation purposes — embed slavery into the Constitution while satisfying neither abolitionists nor slaveholders?",
        "Why did the delegates conduct the entire Convention in secrecy behind locked doors and shuttered windows in Philadelphia's sweltering summer, and what did James Madison's secret notes (published after his death in 1836) reveal about the debates?",
        "How did the electoral college emerge as a compromise between direct popular election (which large states wanted) and congressional selection (which small states wanted) — and why did nobody predict it would produce the problems it has?",
        "What was the ratification battle between Federalists and Anti-Federalists, and how did The Federalist Papers — 85 essays written by Hamilton, Madison, and Jay in just seven months — become the definitive interpretation of the Constitution?"

        "Why did the original Constitution contain no bill of rights, and how did the Anti-Federalists' insistence on amendments before ratification force Madison to draft the first ten amendments?",
        "What did the First Amendment actually protect in 1791 — did 'freedom of speech' mean what it means today, or was it originally understood as a much narrower protection against prior restraint?",
        "How did the Second Amendment's reference to 'a well regulated Militia' become the most contested 27 words in American constitutional law, and what did the Founders actually mean by 'the right to bear arms'?",
        "Why did the Bill of Rights originally apply only to the federal government — not to states — meaning states could and did establish official religions, restrict speech, and violate individual rights until the 14th Amendment (1868)?",
        "What rights did the Constitution deliberately fail to protect — with no mention of voting rights, education, privacy, or equality — and how have these omissions shaped two centuries of political struggle?",
        "How did the Ninth Amendment ('The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people') become either the most important or most ignored amendment depending on one's judicial philosophy?"

        "How did a revolution fought for 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness' produce a constitution that protected slavery without ever using the word — and how did the Founders justify this contradiction to themselves?",
        "Why did northern states gradually abolish slavery between 1777 and 1804 while southern states entrenched it, and what economic factors (not just moral ones) drove this divergence?",
        "What was the significance of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which banned slavery in territories north of the Ohio River while leaving it untouched in the South — drawing a line that would define American politics for 75 years?",
        "How did enslaved people like Elizabeth Freeman (who sued for freedom in Massachusetts in 1781) and the thousands who escaped to British lines use the revolution's own language of liberty against their enslavers?",
        "Why did Thomas Jefferson — who wrote 'all men are created equal' while enslaving over 600 people in his lifetime — represent the revolution's central moral failure rather than an individual contradiction?",
        "How did the Constitution's protections for slavery (the Three-Fifths Clause, the Fugitive Slave Clause, the twenty-year ban on abolishing the slave trade) make the Civil War structurally inevitable?"

        "How did the debate between Hamilton's Federalists (strong central government, national bank, manufacturing economy) and Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans (states' rights, agrarian economy, strict construction) create America's first party system?",
        "What was the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, and why did Washington's decision to march 13,000 troops against Pennsylvania farmers protesting a federal tax establish the principle that the new government would enforce its laws by force?",
        "How did the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 — which criminalized criticism of the government — represent the first major test of the First Amendment, and why did President Adams sign them despite their obvious unconstitutionality?",
        "What was the significance of the election of 1800, when power transferred peacefully from Adams's Federalists to Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans — an event Jefferson called 'the Revolution of 1800'?",
        "How did the Supreme Court under John Marshall (1801-1835) — particularly Marbury v. Madison (1803) establishing judicial review — give the judiciary a power that the Constitution never explicitly granted?"

        "How did the Revolution actually worsen conditions for Indigenous peoples, as the new republic's hunger for western land (freed from British restraint by the Proclamation Line's collapse) accelerated dispossession and violence?",
        "What happened to the Iroquois Confederacy — which split between British and American alliances — and how did the Sullivan-Clinton Campaign of 1779 deliberately destroy 40 Iroquois villages to eliminate indigenous power in New York?",
        "Why did New Jersey's 1776 constitution allow women and free Black men to vote — and why did the state revoke both rights in 1807 when these voters began influencing election outcomes?",
        "How did the concept of 'republican motherhood' simultaneously elevate women's importance (as educators of future citizens) and confine them to the domestic sphere for the next century?",
        "What was the status of free Black people in the new republic — where 60,000 free African Americans lived by 1790 but faced legal restrictions, mob violence, and the constant threat of re-enslavement?"

        "Why has the American Revolution been claimed by movements as diverse as the French Jacobins, Vietnamese communists (Ho Chi Minh quoted the Declaration of Independence in 1945), and modern libertarians — and what does this versatility reveal about the revolution's ambiguity?"

        "What did the Founders actually believe about democracy — given that most of them distrusted direct popular rule, restricted voting to property-owning white men, and designed the Senate and Electoral College specifically to filter popular passions?",
        "How does the modern debate over 'originalism' versus 'living constitution' — whether the Constitution should be interpreted as the Founders intended or as a document that evolves — depend on competing mythologies about the founding generation?",
        "Why did Charles Beard's An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution (1913) — arguing that the Founders were primarily protecting their own financial interests — provoke outrage despite substantial evidence?",
        "How has the 'Founders chic' publishing phenomenon of the 2000s (biographies of Adams, Hamilton, Washington) shaped popular understanding of the revolution — and what gets left out when the revolution is told as a story of great men?",
