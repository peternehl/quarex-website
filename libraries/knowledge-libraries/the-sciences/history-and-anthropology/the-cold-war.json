        "How did the tensions visible at the Yalta (February 1945) and Potsdam (July 1945) conferences — over Poland's borders, German reparations, and Eastern European elections — reveal that the US-Soviet alliance was built on nothing but a shared enemy?",
        "What was the 'Iron Curtain' that Winston Churchill described in his Fulton, Missouri speech of March 5, 1946, and why did Stalin call it a declaration of war?",
        "How did George Kennan's 'Long Telegram' (February 1946) and its published version, the 'X Article' (1947), define the containment strategy that would guide American foreign policy for four decades?",
        "What was the Truman Doctrine (March 1947), why did aid to Greece and Turkey mark America's permanent commitment to opposing communism worldwide, and what precedent did it set for future interventions?",
        "How did the Berlin Blockade (June 1948-May 1949) — Stalin's attempt to starve West Berlin into submission — and the Allied airlift that defeated it become the Cold War's first direct confrontation?",
        "Why did the Soviet atomic bomb test of August 29, 1949 — years earlier than Western intelligence predicted — transform the Cold War from a political rivalry into an existential nuclear standoff?"

        "How did the US hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll (November 1952) — 500 times more powerful than Hiroshima — and the Soviet test nine months later begin a thermonuclear arms race that could destroy civilization?",
        "What was Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD), and how did the doctrine that both superpowers would be annihilated in a nuclear exchange paradoxically prevent nuclear war through the logic of deterrence?",
        "How close did the world come to nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis (October 1962), and what specific decisions by Kennedy, Khrushchev, and Soviet submarine officer Vasili Arkhipov prevented annihilation?",
        "What was the nuclear triad — ICBMs, submarine-launched missiles, and strategic bombers — and why did both superpowers spend trillions ensuring they could destroy the other even after absorbing a first strike?",
        "How did the arms control agreements — the Limited Test Ban Treaty (1963), SALT I (1972), the INF Treaty (1987) — attempt to manage the arms race, and why did hawks on both sides oppose every agreement?",

        "How did General MacArthur's brilliant Inchon landing (September 1950) reverse the war — and how did his disastrous decision to push to the Chinese border provoke China's entry with 300,000 troops?",
        "What happened during the Chinese intervention of November-December 1950, when 300,000 PLA soldiers attacked across the Yalu River and drove UN forces into the longest retreat in US military history?",
        "Why did Truman fire MacArthur in April 1951 — for publicly advocating nuclear strikes on China and insubordination — and what did the resulting political crisis reveal about civilian control of the military?",
        "How did the Korean War kill an estimated 2.5 million civilians and 1.8 million military personnel, devastate the peninsula, and end exactly where it started — at the 38th parallel?",
        "Why does the Korean War remain the 'Forgotten War' in American memory, overshadowed by World War II and Vietnam, despite its lasting consequences including the permanent division of Korea?"

        "What was the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), and how did its investigations of Hollywood — resulting in the blacklisting of hundreds of writers, directors, and actors — demonstrate the chilling effect of anti-communist hysteria?",
        "How did the Rosenberg case (1950-1953) — the trial and execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for atomic espionage — divide America, and what has declassified evidence since revealed about their actual guilt?",
        "Why did the Red Scare extend far beyond government — to universities firing professors, companies requiring loyalty oaths, and libraries removing 'subversive' books — creating a climate of self-censorship that lasted years?",
        "How did Edward R. Murrow's 'See It Now' broadcast of March 9, 1954 and the Army-McCarthy hearings expose McCarthy's methods to the American public, leading to his censure by the Senate?",
        "What lasting damage did McCarthyism inflict on American political culture — from the equation of dissent with disloyalty to the destruction of the American left to the precedent for future political witch hunts?"

        "What was the Tet Offensive of January 1968, and why did a military failure for the Viet Cong become a political catastrophe for the United States by destroying public confidence in the war?",
        "How did the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (December 1979) create the Soviet Union's own 'Vietnam' — a ten-year quagmire that killed 15,000 Soviet soldiers, radicalized a generation of mujahideen, and contributed to the USSR's collapse?",

        "How did proxy wars in Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, and the Horn of Africa turn the African continent into a Cold War battlefield, with millions of civilian casualties in conflicts fueled by superpower arms and advisors?",
