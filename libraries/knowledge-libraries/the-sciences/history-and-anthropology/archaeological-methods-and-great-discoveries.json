      "topics": [
        "How did archaeology evolve from antiquarian treasure hunting — aristocrats collecting Greek vases and Egyptian mummies — into a rigorous scientific discipline with standardized methods for excavation, recording, and interpretation?",
        "What is stratigraphy — the principle that deeper layers of soil are older than those above — and why did this simple insight, borrowed from geology, provide the foundational method for dating archaeological sites?",
        "How do archaeologists decide where to dig — using survey techniques from surface collection and aerial photography to ground-penetrating radar and satellite imagery — before ever putting a trowel in the ground?",
        "What is the archaeological record actually made of — why do stone, ceramics, and bone survive for millennia while wood, textiles, leather, and food usually disappear — and how does this survival bias distort our understanding of the past?",
        "How did the concept of 'context' revolutionize archaeology — why does a potsherd found in situ (in its original position) tell archaeologists far more than the same piece in a museum display case without provenance?",
        "Why is archaeology fundamentally destructive — once you excavate a site, you cannot re-excavate it — and how does this irreversibility create ethical obligations around documentation, preservation, and the decision of whether to dig at all?"

        "How does radiocarbon dating work — measuring the decay of carbon-14 in organic materials to determine age up to roughly 50,000 years — and why did Willard Libby's invention of this technique (Nobel Prize 1960) transform archaeology overnight?",
        "What are the limitations of radiocarbon dating — the calibration problem, contamination, the 'old wood effect,' and the plateau periods where the calibration curve flattens — and how do archaeologists work around them?",
        "How do archaeologists date sites beyond the radiocarbon range — using potassium-argon dating (for volcanic rocks millions of years old), uranium-series dating (for cave formations), and luminescence dating (for heated sediments)?",
        "What is dendrochronology — dating by counting tree rings — and how has the construction of continuous tree-ring sequences extending back over 12,000 years provided both an independent dating method and a calibration tool for radiocarbon?",
        "How does seriation — the principle that artifact styles change over time in predictable ways — allow archaeologists to establish relative chronologies even without absolute dates?",
        "Why has the development of Bayesian statistical methods for combining multiple dating techniques revolutionized archaeological chronology — allowing far more precise timelines than any single method provides?"

        "What was the Rosetta Stone, and how did Jean-Francois Champollion's decipherment of hieroglyphics in 1822 — unlocking a writing system that had been unreadable for 1,400 years — open Egyptian civilization to historical analysis?",
        "How did Howard Carter's discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922 — virtually intact after 3,300 years — capture worldwide imagination and demonstrate what systematic archaeology could reveal about daily life, religion, and politics in ancient Egypt?",
        "What has modern technology revealed about the construction of the pyramids — demolishing theories about alien builders or slave labor and showing organized workforces, supply logistics, and engineering solutions?",
        "How did the rescue archaeology campaign at Abu Simbel (1964-1968) — cutting apart and relocating two massive temples before the Aswan Dam flooded their original site — establish the principle that development projects must protect archaeological heritage?",
        "Why does the debate over repatriation of Egyptian artifacts — the Rosetta Stone in London, the bust of Nefertiti in Berlin, thousands of mummies in collections worldwide — remain one of archaeology's most contentious ethical issues?"

        "What was the significance of George Smith's discovery and translation of the Epic of Gilgamesh (1872) — including a flood narrative that predated and closely paralleled the biblical story of Noah — and how did it shock Victorian England?",
        "How did Heinrich Schliemann's controversial excavation of Troy (1870s) and Mycenae validate Homer's Iliad as containing genuine historical memory — while his destructive methods destroyed much of the evidence he was seeking?",
        "What did Leonard Woolley's excavation of the Royal Tombs of Ur (1920s-1930s) reveal about Mesopotamian civilization — including mass human sacrifice accompanying royal burials and spectacular gold artifacts from 4,500 years ago?",
        "How did the decipherment of cuneiform — from Henry Rawlinson's work on the Behistun inscription to the reading of Sumerian, Akkadian, and Hittite texts — provide direct access to the world's oldest written records?",
        "Why has archaeology in Iraq, Syria, and the broader Middle East been devastated by modern conflict — from the looting of the Iraq Museum in 2003 to ISIS's destruction of Palmyra and Nimrud — and what does the deliberate destruction of heritage reveal about the politics of the past?"

        "What has Pompeii revealed about ordinary Roman life that literary sources do not — the layout of houses, the contents of shops, sexual imagery in public spaces, electoral campaign slogans painted on walls, and the diet of working-class Romans?",
        "How did underwater archaeology — beginning with the excavation of ancient shipwrecks in the Mediterranean — reveal the scale of Roman maritime trade, with cargoes of wine, olive oil, pottery, and building materials crisscrossing the sea?",
        "What have excavations at the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill revealed about how imperial power was performed through architecture — with spaces designed to awe, intimidate, and entertain populations of over a million people?",

        "Why does Classical archaeology face charges of bias — privileging Greek and Roman sites over contemporary civilizations in Africa, Asia, and the Americas — and how has the field begun to address this Eurocentric legacy?"

        "What has LiDAR (light detection and ranging) technology revealed about Maya civilization since 2018 — showing that the jungle conceals interconnected cities, road systems, and agricultural infrastructure housing millions more people than previously estimated?",
        "How did the excavation of Teotihuacan — the enormous city near modern Mexico City that housed 125,000 people at its peak around 450 CE — challenge the assumption that complex urban planning required Old World technology?",
        "What have excavations at Caral in Peru (c. 3000 BCE) — one of the oldest urban centers in the Americas — revealed about the independent invention of civilization in South America, predating Maya and Aztec cultures by millennia?",
        "How did Cahokia — a city near modern St. Louis with a population of 20,000 and a pyramid larger at its base than the Great Pyramid of Giza — challenge the myth that pre-Columbian North America had no urban civilizations?",
