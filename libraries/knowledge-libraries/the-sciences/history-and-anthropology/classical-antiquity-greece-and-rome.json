      "topics": [
        "How did Cleisthenes's reforms of 508 BCE create the world's first democracy — and why did it exclude women, slaves, and foreigners, leaving only about 30,000 out of 300,000 residents eligible to vote?",
        "What was the Athenian Assembly (Ekklesia), how did 6,000 citizens gather on the Pnyx hill to debate and vote on war, taxes, and exile, and why did Socrates call it rule by the ignorant mob?",
        "How did ostracism work — citizens scratching a name on a potsherd to exile someone for ten years — and why did Athens use it against some of its most capable leaders?",
        "What role did the Athenian jury system play, with juries of 201 to 501 citizens deciding cases in a single day, and how did Socrates's trial in 399 BCE expose its flaws?",
        "Why did Pericles's Funeral Oration (431 BCE) — praising Athens as a school for all of Greece — become the founding text of democratic idealism despite being delivered during a war Athens would lose?",
        "How did Athenian democracy die — was it the Peloponnesian War, internal oligarchic coups, or Macedonian conquest — and what does its 180-year lifespan say about democracy's vulnerability?"

        "How did Sparta's entire social system — from taking boys from their families at age seven to the communal mess halls (syssitia) — function as a machine for producing soldiers?",
        "What was the helot system, and how did Sparta's dependence on enslaved Messenians — who outnumbered Spartans roughly seven to one — shape every aspect of Spartan militarism and paranoia?",
        "Why did the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae (480 BCE) become history's most famous last stand, and how much of the story as we know it is propaganda crafted by Herodotus?",
        "How did Spartan women enjoy more freedom than women anywhere else in Greece — owning property, exercising publicly, speaking freely — and why did other Greeks find this scandalous?",
        "What was the Spartan mirage — the tendency of ancient and modern admirers to idealize Sparta as a model of discipline and virtue — and what did this idealization conceal about Spartan brutality?",
        "Why did Sparta decline so rapidly after its victory over Athens in 404 BCE, going from Greek hegemon to irrelevant backwater within a century?"

        "How did Plato's Republic — with its philosopher-kings, noble lies, and censored art — propose a political system that has been called both the blueprint for utopia and the blueprint for totalitarianism?",
        "What did Aristotle mean by claiming humans are 'political animals,' and how did his systematic classification of 158 Greek constitutions produce the first comparative political science?",
        "How did the pre-Socratic philosophers — Thales, Heraclitus, Democritus, Parmenides — attempt to explain the natural world without gods, inventing what we now call scientific thinking?",
        "Why did the Stoics (Zeno), Epicureans (Epicurus), and Cynics (Diogenes) each offer radically different answers to the question of how to live a good life, and which school's ideas most resemble modern psychology?",
        "How did Greek philosophy reach the Islamic world through Syriac translations in the 8th-9th centuries, and why did Muslim scholars preserve and advance Aristotle's work while Europe forgot him?"

        "Why did Alexander's attempt to fuse Greek and Persian cultures — wearing Persian dress, adopting proskynesis (prostration), marrying Roxana and Stateira — enrage his own Macedonian officers?",
        "What happened when Alexander died at 32 in Babylon (323 BCE), leaving no clear successor, and how did the Wars of the Diadochi carve his empire into three rival kingdoms?",
        "How did the Hellenistic period (323-31 BCE) spread Greek language, architecture, and ideas from Egypt to Afghanistan, creating cosmopolitan cities like Alexandria with its 700,000-scroll library?",
        "What scientific advances occurred in the Hellenistic world — Eratosthenes calculating Earth's circumference, Archimedes discovering buoyancy, Aristarchus proposing heliocentrism — and why were some forgotten for 1,800 years?",
        "How did Hellenistic culture eventually merge with Roman power, and why did the Romans conquer Greece militarily while Greece conquered Rome culturally?"

        "How did the Gracchi brothers' land reform proposals (133 and 123 BCE) — moderate by any standard — provoke such violent senatorial backlash that both were murdered, setting the precedent for political assassination?",
        "Why did the Roman Republic's final century (133-27 BCE) descend into civil wars between Marius and Sulla, Caesar and Pompey, Octavian and Antony — and what structural failures made the republic unable to survive its own success?"

        "What specific events forced Caesar to cross the Rubicon with his army on January 10, 49 BCE, triggering civil war, and what did the Senate do that left him no legal alternative?",
        "How did Caesar's dictatorship (49-44 BCE) — with its land redistribution, calendar reform, citizenship expansion, and public works — simultaneously address real social problems and destroy republican norms?",
        "Why did 60 senators conspire to assassinate Caesar on the Ides of March (44 BCE), and how did Brutus and Cassius convince themselves that murder would restore the republic rather than destroy it?",
        "What did Mark Antony's funeral speech actually accomplish — how did displaying Caesar's bloody toga and reading his will (which left money to every Roman citizen) turn the crowd against the assassins?",
