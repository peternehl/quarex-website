        "How did Mussolini's March on Rome (1922) demonstrate that a determined minority could seize power in a democracy when democratic institutions refused to defend themselves?",
        "What specific economic conditions — hyperinflation in 1923, then the Great Depression after 1929 — destroyed the Weimar Republic and created the desperation that Hitler exploited?",
        "How did Hitler go from a failed painter and beer hall putschist (1923) to Chancellor of Germany in just ten years, and what role did conservative elites play in handing him power on January 30, 1933?",
        "What was the Enabling Act of March 23, 1933, and how did it allow Hitler to destroy German democracy legally — with the Reichstag voting itself out of existence?",
        "How did Japan's military gradually seize control of civilian government during the 1930s, and what role did the assassination of moderate politicians play in silencing opposition?",
        "Why did Francisco Franco's victory in the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) — aided by German and Italian intervention while democracies maintained neutrality — serve as a dress rehearsal for World War II?"

        "What exactly happened at Munich in September 1938, and why did Neville Chamberlain's 'peace for our time' declaration become the most infamous example of diplomatic failure in modern history?",
        "How did the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 23, 1939 — with its secret protocol dividing Poland and the Baltic states between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union — shock the world and make war inevitable?",
        "What was Japan's 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,' and how did Tokyo frame its imperial expansion as liberation from Western colonialism while practicing brutality that matched or exceeded European colonial violence?",
        "How did the Rape of Nanking (December 1937-January 1938) — where Japanese troops killed an estimated 200,000-300,000 Chinese civilians in six weeks — reveal the nature of Japan's war in Asia years before Pearl Harbor?",
        "Why did the League of Nations fail to stop any act of aggression in the 1930s — Japanese conquest of Manchuria, Italian conquest of Ethiopia, German annexations — and what structural weaknesses made collective security impossible?"

        "What happened at Dunkirk (May 26-June 4, 1940), where 338,226 Allied soldiers were evacuated across the English Channel, and why did Hitler order his tanks to halt — a decision that may have changed the war's outcome?",
        "How did the Battle of Britain (July-October 1940) — the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces — prevent a German invasion and prove that Hitler could be stopped?",

        "How did the Soviet Union relocate 1,500 factories eastward beyond the Ural Mountains in 1941-1942, producing 30,000 tanks and 40,000 aircraft annually by 1944 — outproducing Germany despite losing its industrial heartland?",
