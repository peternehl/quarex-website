        "How did the split between the human and chimpanzee lineages (approximately 6-7 million years ago) produce two radically different outcomes from a common ancestor — and what environmental pressures in East Africa drove early hominins onto two legs?",
        "What did the discovery of Sahelanthropus tchadensis (Toumai, c. 7 million years ago) in Chad reveal about the geography of early human evolution — challenging the long-held assumption that bipedalism originated exclusively in East Africa's Rift Valley?",
        "Why is bipedalism considered the defining adaptation of the human lineage — what advantages did walking upright provide (freeing hands, energy efficiency, thermoregulation) and what costs did it impose (back pain, difficult childbirth, knee injuries)?",
        "How did Ardipithecus ramidus ('Ardi,' c. 4.4 million years ago) challenge the 'savanna hypothesis' by showing that early bipeds lived in wooded environments rather than open grasslands?",
        "What was 'Lucy' (Australopithecus afarensis, c. 3.2 million years ago), why did her discovery in Ethiopia in 1974 transform paleoanthropology, and what did her combination of small brain and bipedal locomotion reveal about the sequence of human evolution?",
        "How did multiple species of early hominins coexist in Africa for millions of years — Australopithecus afarensis, africanus, garhi, and the robust Paranthropus lineage — and why did most of these evolutionary experiments end in extinction?"

      "topics": [
        "How did the emergence of the genus Homo (c. 2.8 million years ago) represent a decisive shift — with Homo habilis producing the first stone tools (Oldowan industry) and beginning the feedback loop between tool use and brain expansion?",
        "What was Homo erectus's achievement — the first hominin to master fire, develop more sophisticated tools (Acheulean hand axes), and migrate out of Africa into Asia and Europe beginning around 1.8 million years ago?",
        "How did brain size triple from Australopithecus (400-500 cc) to modern Homo sapiens (1,400 cc) over 3 million years, and what were the costs of this expansion — longer childhoods, more calories needed, dangerous childbirth?",
        "What was the 'expensive tissue hypothesis' — the idea that human brains could grow larger only because cooking food (made possible by fire) reduced the energy cost of digestion — and how did Richard Wrangham's evidence support it?",
        "How did Homo erectus survive for nearly 2 million years — longer than any other hominin species — colonizing environments from tropical Indonesia to glacial Europe, and what drove their eventual extinction?",
        "Why does the fossil record show that human evolution was not a linear march of progress — with multiple Homo species (habilis, erectus, heidelbergensis, naledi) overlapping in time and space — contradicting the popular 'ascent of man' image?"

        "What evidence shows that Neanderthals had complex culture — burying their dead (sometimes with grave goods), creating art, using medicinal plants, caring for disabled individuals, and producing sophisticated tools (Mousterian industry)?",
        "How did Neanderthals survive Ice Age Europe for hundreds of thousands of years — hunting megafauna like mammoths and woolly rhinos in environments so harsh that their bones show patterns of injury comparable to rodeo riders?",
        "What did the sequencing of the Neanderthal genome by Svante Paabo (Nobel Prize 2022) reveal — that modern non-African humans carry 1-4% Neanderthal DNA, proving that our ancestors interbred with Neanderthals rather than simply replacing them?",
        "Why did Neanderthals go extinct approximately 40,000 years ago — was it climate change, competition with Homo sapiens, disease, lower reproductive rates, or a combination — and why does this question matter for understanding human uniqueness?",
        "How did the discovery of Denisovans — known initially from a single finger bone in a Siberian cave — reveal yet another human species that interbred with our ancestors, with Denisovan DNA still influencing Tibetan altitude adaptation today?"

        "How did the 'Out of Africa' theory — the idea that all modern humans descended from a population in Africa roughly 300,000 years ago — triumph over the 'multiregional' hypothesis through genetic, fossil, and archaeological evidence?",
        "What do the earliest Homo sapiens fossils (Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, c. 300,000 years ago; Omo Kibish, Ethiopia, c. 195,000 years ago) tell us about where and when our species first appeared?",
        "What was the 'cognitive revolution' or 'great leap forward' (c. 70,000-50,000 years ago) — the explosion of symbolic behavior including art, jewelry, complex tools, and long-distance trade — and was it a sudden breakthrough or a gradual accumulation?",
        "How did language evolve — when did humans develop the capacity for complex symbolic communication — and why is this the hardest question in human evolution, since language leaves no fossils?",
        "What was the Toba catastrophe theory — the idea that a massive volcanic eruption 74,000 years ago nearly drove humanity to extinction, reducing the population to perhaps 10,000 individuals — and how has genetic evidence both supported and complicated it?",
        "Why does genetic evidence show that all non-African humans descended from a relatively small population that left Africa roughly 70,000 years ago — meaning that the vast majority of human genetic diversity exists within Africa?"

        "What challenges did the first humans to reach Australia face — crossing at least 90 kilometers of open ocean, then adapting to a continent with entirely unfamiliar animals and plants — and what does their success reveal about early human capability?",
        "How did humans colonize the Americas — did they walk across the Bering land bridge, follow the Pacific coast by boat, or both — and why do pre-Clovis sites like Monte Verde (Chile, 14,500 years ago) keep pushing the timeline back?",
        "What was the role of maritime migration — from the colonization of Pacific islands to the settlement of Japan and the Philippines — and why does coastal migration challenge the land-bridge-focused narrative of human expansion?",
        "How did the extinction of megafauna — giant ground sloths in the Americas, diprotodonts in Australia, mammoths in Eurasia — correlate with human arrival, and what evidence supports the 'overkill hypothesis' versus climate change?",
        "Why did the colonization of remote Pacific islands (Hawaii c. 1000 CE, New Zealand c. 1280 CE, Easter Island c. 1200 CE) by Polynesian navigators represent one of the greatest feats of exploration in human history?"

        "What did Jared Diamond mean by calling agriculture 'the worst mistake in the history of the human race' — how did farming produce shorter stature, worse nutrition, more disease, longer working hours, and social inequality compared to foraging?",
        "How did the domestication of wheat, rice, maize, and potatoes reshape human societies — with each staple crop producing different settlement patterns, labor requirements, and social structures?",
        "What was the 'secondary products revolution' — the shift from killing animals for meat to exploiting them for milk, wool, labor, and transport — and how did it transform economies across Eurasia and Africa?",
        "How did agriculture create the conditions for civilization — surplus food enabling specialization, villages growing into cities, priests and kings emerging to manage stored grain — while simultaneously creating class hierarchy, warfare, and environmental destruction?",
        "Why did some societies (Aboriginal Australians, many Amazonian peoples, Arctic cultures) never adopt agriculture despite being aware of it — and what does their choice reveal about the assumption that agriculture represents 'progress'?"

        "What is the 'out of Africa' bottleneck effect, and why does the fact that all non-African populations descended from a small founding group mean that Africans have far greater genetic diversity than the rest of the world combined?",
        "How did the misuse of evolutionary science produce eugenics — from Francis Galton's original proposals through forced sterilization programs in 32 US states to Nazi racial hygiene — and why do geneticists today fight to prevent their research from being weaponized?",
        "What has ancient DNA analysis revealed about human population history — that modern Europeans are a mixture of three ancestral populations, that the people who built Stonehenge were replaced by migrants, and that population replacement was common throughout history?",
        "Why does the concept of 'race' persist as a powerful social reality despite having no scientific basis — and what is the difference between acknowledging human biological variation and classifying people into racial hierarchies?"

        "How did the evolution of language transform human cognition — enabling abstract thought, planning for the future, sharing knowledge across generations, and coordinating group action at scales impossible for any other species?",
        "What is 'cumulative cultural evolution' — the ratchet effect by which each generation builds on the inventions of the previous one — and why does no other species exhibit this capacity for sustained technological and cultural accumulation?",

        "What was the 'Hobbit' controversy — the discovery of Homo floresiensis on the Indonesian island of Flores in 2003 — and why did a meter-tall hominin surviving until 50,000 years ago challenge assumptions about human evolution?",
        "How has ancient DNA analysis (Svante Paabo's paleogenomics, Nobel Prize 2022) revolutionized the field — revealing interbreeding between species, tracking migrations, and overturning theories based solely on fossils?",
        "Why has the discovery of Homo naledi in South Africa's Rising Star cave (2013-2015) — with its small brain but possible deliberate burial of the dead — challenged the assumption that large brains were necessary for complex behavior?",

        "How has modern medicine altered evolutionary pressures — by allowing people with conditions that would have been fatal (diabetes, poor eyesight, genetic diseases) to survive and reproduce — and is this 'dysgenic' or simply irrelevant?",
        "What are the implications of CRISPR gene editing for human evolution — if we can edit the germline, are we taking control of our own evolutionary future, and who decides which edits are acceptable?",
        "How might space colonization create new evolutionary pressures — with populations on Mars or in space stations experiencing different gravity, radiation, and social conditions that could drive divergence from Earth-bound humans?",
