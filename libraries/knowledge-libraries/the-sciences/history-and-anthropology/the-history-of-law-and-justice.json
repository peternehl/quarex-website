      "name": "The Origins of Law: From Hammurabi to Roman Jurisprudence",
      "topics": [
        "What was the Code of Hammurabi (c. 1754 BCE) — 282 laws carved on a stone stele in ancient Babylon — and why does its principle of proportional punishment ('an eye for an eye') represent an advance over unlimited vengeance?",
        "How did ancient legal systems differ in their sources of authority — Mesopotamian codes claiming divine mandate, Athenian law claiming democratic consent, Confucian law emphasizing moral education — and why do these different foundations still shape legal traditions today?",
        "What was Roman law's greatest contribution — the Corpus Juris Civilis compiled under Justinian (529-534 CE) — and why did its systematic organization of legal principles, contracts, property rights, and civil procedure become the foundation of legal systems across continental Europe and Latin America?",
        "How did ancient Athenian law courts function — with juries of 501 citizens, no lawyers, and verdicts decided by majority vote — and what were the consequences of a system where rhetoric mattered more than evidence?",
        "What was the distinction between natural law (universal moral principles discoverable by reason) and positive law (rules enacted by human authority), and why has this 2,500-year-old philosophical debate — from Aristotle through Aquinas to modern human rights — never been resolved?",
        "How did religious law — Jewish halakha, Islamic sharia, Hindu dharmashastra, Christian canon law — develop parallel legal systems that governed daily life, family relations, and commercial transactions alongside or in competition with secular law?"

      "name": "Common Law vs. Civil Law: Two Legal Families",
      "topics": [
        "What is common law — the system originating in medieval England where judges create law through decisions that become binding precedent — and why does it now govern nearly a third of the world's population?",
        "How did the Magna Carta (1215) — extracted from King John by rebellious barons — establish principles (no taxation without consent, no imprisonment without trial, the king is subject to law) that became foundational to constitutional government?",
        "What is civil law — the system derived from Roman law and Napoleonic codification where comprehensive legal codes, not judicial precedent, are the primary source of law — and why does it govern most of continental Europe, Latin America, and parts of Asia and Africa?",
        "How did Napoleon's Civil Code (1804) — a systematic codification of French law covering persons, property, and obligations — spread across Europe through conquest and influence, becoming the model for legal systems from Louisiana to Japan?",
        "What are the practical consequences of the common law/civil law divide — different roles for judges and lawyers, different approaches to precedent, different trial procedures — and why has this 800-year-old split proven remarkably durable?",
        "How have mixed legal systems — Louisiana combining French civil law with American common law, South Africa blending Roman-Dutch law with English common law, Japan grafting German codes onto Confucian traditions — adapted to legal pluralism?"

      "topics": [
        "How did punishment evolve from public spectacles of pain — branding, mutilation, drawing and quartering, burning at the stake — to imprisonment as the default punishment, and was this shift driven by humanitarian concern or new techniques of social control?",
        "What was the invention of the modern prison — from the Quaker penitentiary model (Eastern State, 1829) based on solitary reflection to the Auburn system based on congregate labor and silence — and why did both produce psychological devastation rather than reform?",
        "How did Cesare Beccaria's On Crimes and Punishments (1764) — arguing against torture, for proportional punishment, and for the prevention of crime over its punishment — influence the legal reforms of the Enlightenment?",
        "Why does the United States incarcerate more people than any country in history — 2.3 million people, disproportionately Black and Latino — and how did the War on Drugs, mandatory minimums, and three-strikes laws produce mass incarceration?",
        "What is the global trajectory of the death penalty — from universal practice to abolition in 106 countries — and why do the United States, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt continue to execute prisoners while most democracies have abandoned it?",
        "How has restorative justice — which brings offenders face-to-face with victims to acknowledge harm and agree on reparation — challenged the retributive model, and what evidence exists that it reduces recidivism?"

        "How did the US Constitution (1787) and Bill of Rights (1791) create the template for constitutional governance — separation of powers, federalism, judicial review, enumerated rights — that has been adapted by over 150 countries?",
        "What was Marbury v. Madison (1803) — the Supreme Court case where Chief Justice John Marshall established the principle that courts can declare laws unconstitutional — and why is judicial review now the most powerful tool for protecting individual rights?",
        "How did the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen (1789) — proclaiming liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression as natural rights — establish a different constitutional tradition focused on positive rights and state obligations?",
        "What was the significance of Brown v. Board of Education (1954) — the Supreme Court ruling that racial segregation in public schools is unconstitutional — and why did implementation require a decade of federal intervention, court orders, and armed enforcement?",
        "How do constitutions fail — from the Weimar Republic's collapse into Nazi dictatorship to the erosion of democratic constitutions in Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela through legal means — and what structural features make constitutions resilient or fragile?",
        "Why has the concept of 'constitutional identity' — the idea that certain constitutional principles (human dignity, secularism, federalism) are so fundamental they cannot be amended — emerged as a response to democratic backsliding?"

        "How did the Peace of Westphalia (1648) establish the principle of state sovereignty — that each nation has exclusive authority within its borders — creating the foundation of international law while also making it nearly impossible to prevent atrocities within sovereign states?",
        "What was Hugo Grotius's contribution — his Law of War and Peace (1625) arguing that even in war, certain rules apply — and why is he called the 'father of international law' even though states routinely ignore his principles?",
        "How did the Geneva Conventions (1864-1949) and their Additional Protocols establish the laws of war — protecting prisoners, civilians, and the wounded — and why does compliance remain selective, with powerful states often claiming exceptions?",
        "What was the Nuremberg Tribunal (1945-1946), how did it establish the principle that 'following orders' is not a defense for war crimes, and why was it criticized as 'victors' justice' while simultaneously creating the legal foundation for international criminal law?",
        "How does the International Criminal Court (established 2002) function — prosecuting genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and aggression — and why have the US, Russia, China, India, and Israel refused to join?",
        "Why is international law described as 'law without enforcement' — with no global police force, no binding jurisdiction over unwilling states, and no mechanism to compel compliance — and what makes states comply when they do?"

        "How did the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) — drafted by Eleanor Roosevelt's committee representing diverse legal traditions — establish the aspiration that all human beings are 'born free and equal in dignity and rights'?",
        "What is the difference between civil and political rights (freedom of speech, fair trial, voting) and economic and social rights (food, housing, education, healthcare) — and why did the Cold War split these into two separate treaties that the US still hasn't fully ratified?",
        "How did the European Convention on Human Rights (1950) and its Court create the world's most effective human rights enforcement mechanism — where individuals can sue their own governments and court judgments are binding?",
        "What was the significance of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW, 1979) and why is it the most-reserved human rights treaty — with dozens of countries accepting it in principle while exempting themselves from its key provisions?",
        "How have truth and reconciliation commissions — from South Africa's TRC (1996) to similar bodies in Argentina, Chile, and Canada — attempted to address mass human rights violations through testimony and acknowledgment rather than prosecution?",
        "Why do critics argue that human rights law serves Western hegemony — imposing individualistic liberal values on societies with communitarian traditions — while defenders counter that torture, arbitrary detention, and discrimination are wrong everywhere?"

        "What was the legal status of women throughout most of history — coverture (married women's legal identity absorbed by husbands), exclusion from property ownership, disenfranchisement, and legal tolerance of domestic violence — and how long did reform take?",
        "How did the civil rights movement use litigation as a strategy — from Thurgood Marshall's NAACP cases to the Civil Rights Act (1964) and Voting Rights Act (1965) — demonstrating that courts can be engines of social change?",
        "What is critical legal studies — the academic movement arguing that law is not neutral but reflects and reinforces existing power structures — and how has it influenced debates about criminal justice reform, environmental law, and corporate regulation?",
        "How does access to legal representation determine outcomes — with studies showing that the quality of your lawyer matters more than the facts of your case — and what does this mean for the 80% of Americans who cannot afford legal help?",
        "Why do indigenous peoples face unique legal challenges — from the doctrine of discovery (which justified European seizure of indigenous lands) to ongoing battles over land rights, treaty obligations, and self-governance?"

        "What is intellectual property law — patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets — and why has the digital revolution (where copying is free and instantaneous) created a crisis for legal frameworks designed for physical objects?",
        "How has surveillance technology — from wiretapping to CCTV to smartphone location tracking to facial recognition — continuously outpaced the legal frameworks designed to protect privacy?",

        "How has social media challenged defamation, harassment, and free speech law — with platforms operating across jurisdictions, content moderation decisions affecting billions of users, and the legal status of online speech still unresolved?",
        "Why does the history of law and technology show a persistent pattern — new technologies creating harms faster than legal systems can respond — and what institutional reforms might close this gap?"

        "What was the significance of the Stockholm Declaration (1972) — the first international agreement recognizing the right to a healthy environment — and why has the gap between environmental law on paper and environmental protection in practice remained so wide?",

        "How have courts become a battleground for climate policy — with cases like Urgenda v. Netherlands (2019) successfully ordering governments to reduce emissions, while other cases challenging fossil fuel companies remain unresolved?",
        "Why has the concept of 'rights of nature' — granting legal personhood to rivers (New Zealand's Whanganui, 2017), ecosystems (Ecuador's constitution, 2008), and natural features — emerged as a radical alternative to human-centered environmental law?"

        "What is the future of privacy law — with biometric data, genetic information, brain-computer interfaces, and ubiquitous surveillance creating categories of personal information that existing legal frameworks were never designed to protect?",
        "How should law govern autonomous weapons, gene editing, and artificial general intelligence — technologies that could fundamentally alter human warfare, biology, and cognition — and why do existing legal frameworks fail?",

        "Why does the fundamental tension in law remain unresolved — between law as a tool for protecting the powerful (property rights, corporate law, immigration enforcement) and law as a tool for constraining power (constitutional rights, labor law, human rights) — and which function has historically prevailed?"
