        "Why did the Industrial Revolution begin in Britain in the 1760s rather than in China, which had comparable technology, or the Netherlands, which had more capital?",
        "How did Britain's unique combination of cheap coal, expensive labor, and accessible waterways create the economic incentive to mechanize production?",
        "What role did the Enclosure Acts play in driving millions of rural farmers off common land and into factory towns between 1750 and 1850?",
        "How did Britain's patent system — specifically the Statute of Monopolies (1624) — create financial incentives for invention that other countries lacked?",
        "Why was the Agricultural Revolution of the 18th century (Jethro Tull's seed drill, crop rotation, selective breeding) a necessary precondition for industrialization?",
        "How did Britain's colonial empire provide both the raw materials (cotton from India, sugar from the Caribbean) and the captive markets that fueled early industrialization?"

        "How did Richard Trevithick's high-pressure steam engine (1801) make Watt's design obsolete and open the door to locomotives and steamships?",

        "What happened to the handloom weavers of Britain, whose numbers peaked at 250,000 in 1820 and collapsed to near zero by 1850 as power looms replaced them?",
        "How did Eli Whitney's cotton gin (1793) make short-staple cotton profitable and directly cause the westward expansion of American slavery into Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana?",
        "Why did textile workers destroy machinery during the Luddite uprisings of 1811-1816, and what does Parliament's response — making machine-breaking a capital offense — reveal about state priorities?"
