        "What do the cave paintings of Lascaux (c. 17,000 BCE) and Chauvet (c. 36,000 BCE) — depicting animals, handprints, and possibly shamanic figures — tell us about the earliest forms of human religious expression?",
        "How did Gobekli Tepe (c. 9600 BCE) — a massive stone monument complex built by hunter-gatherers before agriculture, pottery, or permanent settlements — overturn the assumption that religion was a product of civilization rather than its catalyst?",
        "What was ancestor worship, and why did virtually every early human society develop rituals around death — from Neanderthal flower burials (c. 60,000 BCE) to Egyptian mummification — suggesting that confronting mortality is the origin of religious thought?",
        "How did shamanism — the practice of achieving altered states of consciousness to communicate with spirits, heal illness, and predict the future — function across Siberian, African, Australian, and American indigenous cultures?",
        "Why did the transition from hunting-gathering to agriculture (c. 10,000 BCE) transform religious practice — shifting from animal spirits and nature gods to fertility cults, harvest rituals, and the emergence of organized priesthoods?",
        "What do comparative studies of prehistoric religion reveal about universal human patterns — the burial of the dead, the marking of sacred spaces, the use of psychoactive substances, and the belief in an unseen world — that transcend any single culture?"

      "topics": [
        "Why did polytheism dominate human religious experience for millennia, and what specific social functions did having multiple gods — of war, fertility, harvest, death, justice — serve that a single deity could not?",
        "How did ancient Egyptian religion — with its elaborate afterlife beliefs, the weighing of the heart, 2,000 deities, and temple complexes employing thousands of priests — sustain a civilization for 3,000 years?",
        "What was the relationship between Mesopotamian religion and power — how did kings claim divine mandate, temples function as economic centers, and priests control access to the gods through ritual and divination?",
        "How did Greek mythology function as both entertainment and philosophical inquiry — with stories about Zeus, Prometheus, Odysseus, and Oedipus exploring questions of fate, justice, and the human condition?",
        "Why did the Roman Empire adopt and adapt the religions of conquered peoples — syncretizing Greek gods, Egyptian Isis, Persian Mithras, and eventually Christianity — rather than imposing a single faith?",
        "How did polytheistic religions decline — was it the intellectual critique of philosophers (Xenophanes, Epicurus), the appeal of mystery religions offering personal salvation, or the political triumph of Christianity and Islam?"

        "How did ancient Israelite religion evolve from henotheism ('our god is the most powerful') to strict monotheism ('there is only one God') — a transition that occurred over centuries and represented a radical break from every surrounding culture?",
        "What was the significance of the Babylonian Exile (586-538 BCE) — when the destruction of the Temple and deportation to Babylon forced Judaism to reinvent itself as a religion centered on scripture, law, and community rather than a temple cult?",
        "How did the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) come to be assembled, edited, and canonized — a process spanning centuries — and what does textual analysis reveal about its multiple authors, contradictions, and layers of revision?",
        "Why did the destruction of the Second Temple by Rome in 70 CE transform Judaism permanently — ending the priesthood and sacrificial system and establishing rabbinic Judaism, centered on Torah study and synagogue worship, as the surviving form?",
        "How did Jewish communities survive 2,000 years of diaspora, persecution, and pressure to convert — from the Roman Empire through medieval expulsions to the Holocaust — while maintaining a continuous religious and cultural identity?",
        "What is the relationship between Judaism and its 'daughter religions' — Christianity and Islam — and how have theological similarities (monotheism, prophetic tradition, ethical commandments) coexisted with centuries of conflict?"

        "How did a Jewish apocalyptic movement centered on a crucified preacher in Roman Palestine become the world's largest religion within three centuries — and what social, political, and theological factors drove this extraordinary expansion?",
        "What role did Paul of Tarsus play in transforming Christianity from a Jewish sect into a universal religion — opening it to Gentiles, developing its theology of salvation through faith, and establishing churches across the Roman Empire?",
        "How did the Council of Nicaea (325 CE) and subsequent ecumenical councils define Christian orthodoxy — deciding that Jesus was fully God and fully human, that the Trinity was one God in three persons — while condemning alternative interpretations as heresy?",
        "What caused the Great Schism of 1054 between the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy, and why have these two branches of Christianity — differing on papal authority, the Filioque clause, and clerical celibacy — remained separate for nearly a millennium?",
        "How did the Protestant Reformation — triggered by Luther's 95 Theses (1517), sustained by the printing press, and diversified by Calvin, Zwingli, and the Anabaptists — shatter Western Christian unity and reshape European politics, economics, and culture?",
        "Why did Christianity spread globally through colonialism — with missionaries accompanying conquistadors, slave traders, and colonial administrators — and how have post-colonial churches in Africa, Asia, and Latin America reinterpreted the faith on their own terms?"

        "How did Muhammad's revelations (610-632 CE) — received in a cave near Mecca and compiled into the Quran — create a religion that within a century governed territory from Spain to Central Asia?",
        "What are the Five Pillars of Islam (shahada, salat, zakat, sawm, hajj), and how do they create a framework of practice that unifies 1.8 billion Muslims across vastly different cultures?",
        "How did Islamic law (Sharia) develop from Quranic verses and the Prophet's example (hadith) into a comprehensive legal system — and why do the four Sunni schools of jurisprudence (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali) offer different interpretations of the same sources?",
        "What was Sufism, and how did the mystical tradition within Islam — from Rumi's ecstatic poetry to the Sufi orders (tariqas) that spread Islam across Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia — offer an experiential alternative to legalistic orthodoxy?",
        "How did the decline of the Ottoman Caliphate and European colonialism produce modernist movements (Muhammad Abduh), revivalist movements (the Muslim Brotherhood, Wahhabism), and secularist experiments (Ataturk's Turkey, Nasser's Egypt)?",
        "Why does Islam remain the fastest-growing religion in the world (projected to match Christianity's numbers by 2060), and what internal debates — about women's rights, democratic governance, and the role of religion in public life — are shaping its future?"

        "How did Hinduism evolve from Vedic ritual religion (c. 1500 BCE) through the philosophical revolutions of the Upanishads (c. 800-200 BCE) to the devotional traditions (bhakti) that define modern Hindu practice — without a single founder, a single scripture, or a single creed?",
        "What was the Buddha's core teaching — the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path — and how did this radical rejection of caste, ritual, and divine authority represent a revolution within the Indian religious tradition?",
        "How did Buddhism spread from India across Asia — Theravada to Southeast Asia, Mahayana to China and Korea, Vajrayana to Tibet — adapting to local cultures so thoroughly that its forms in Thailand, Japan, and Tibet are barely recognizable as the same religion?",
        "What was the Hindu-Buddhist synthesis in Southeast Asia — visible in Angkor Wat, Borobudur, and Balinese culture — and how did these traditions coexist and blend in ways that defied the exclusivism of Abrahamic religions?",
        "How did Confucianism and Daoism in China, and Shinto in Japan, function as complementary religious systems — addressing social ethics, cosmic harmony, and nature worship respectively — in contrast to the Western pattern of competing exclusive truth claims?",

        "What was the Enlightenment critique of religion — from Voltaire's satire to Hume's skepticism to Kant's 'religion within the limits of reason alone' — and how did it produce the concept of secularism that now governs most Western democracies?",
        "How did the 'death of God' thesis — articulated by Nietzsche (1882) and elaborated by mid-20th-century secularization theorists — predict religion's decline, and why has the prediction proven spectacularly wrong globally even as it holds in Western Europe?",
        "What was the relationship between religion and totalitarianism — how did Nazi Germany co-opt Christianity, how did the Soviet Union attempt to destroy religion, and how did Maoist China's Cultural Revolution target Buddhist temples, Confucian traditions, and Christian churches?",
        "How has the 'New Atheism' of Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, and Dennett (2004-2010) differed from earlier secular critiques — and why did their aggressive approach alienate some secularists while energizing religious conservatives?",
        "Why do 84% of the world's 8 billion people identify with a religious tradition — and what does the persistence of religious belief, despite scientific advances and secularization, reveal about the human need for meaning, community, and transcendence?"

        "What was the relationship between religion and American politics — from the Puritan founding through the Social Gospel, the civil rights movement's Black churches, the Religious Right of the 1980s, and Christian nationalism today?",
        "How did the Iranian Revolution of 1979 demonstrate that the 'secularization thesis' was wrong — that modernization does not inevitably produce secular societies — and inspire Islamist movements from Egypt to Afghanistan?",
        "What is Hindu nationalism (Hindutva) in India, Buddhist nationalism in Myanmar and Sri Lanka, and Jewish religious nationalism in Israel — and why have religious nationalist movements surged globally in the 21st century?",
        "How do religious freedom and secular governance conflict in practice — from the French headscarf ban to US debates over contraception mandates to blasphemy laws in Pakistan — and what principles should govern the boundary?",
        "Why has religious polarization intensified in the 21st century — with evangelical Christianity aligning with right-wing populism, Islam being weaponized by both jihadists and Islamophobes, and secular progressives dismissing religion as backward?"

        "How has religion shaped moral progress — abolition movements led by Quakers and evangelicals, the civil rights movement led by Black churches, liberation theology in Latin America — alongside its role in justifying slavery, colonialism, and oppression?",
        "What happens to societies that lose religion — does secular humanism provide adequate answers to questions of meaning, death, community, and moral obligation, or does the absence of shared sacred narratives create a vacuum that politics cannot fill?",
        "How are religions adapting to the modern world — from Pope Francis's engagement with climate change to progressive Islam to Buddhist mindfulness in corporate wellness programs — and what do these adaptations gain and lose?",
        "Why does the question 'Is religion a net positive or negative for humanity?' resist a simple answer — and what does the attempt to weigh cathedrals against crusades, hospitals against inquisitions, and community against tribalism reveal about the complexity of religious experience?"
