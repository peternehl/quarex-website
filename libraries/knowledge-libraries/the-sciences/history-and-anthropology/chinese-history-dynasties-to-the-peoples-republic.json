        "How did the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE) — lasting only 15 years — permanently shape China by unifying the writing system, standardizing weights and measures, building the first Great Wall sections, and establishing the template for centralized imperial rule?",
        "Why did the Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) endure for over 400 years, and how did its civil service examination system, Confucian state ideology, and Silk Road trade create the cultural framework that defines Chinese identity today?",
        "What was the significance of the Mandate of Heaven doctrine in Chinese politics — how did it simultaneously legitimize ruling dynasties and justify their overthrow when they lost heaven's favor through corruption or incompetence?",
        "How did the Han Dynasty's population of 60 million — comparable to the Roman Empire — sustain itself through advanced agriculture, iron technology, and a state monopoly on salt and iron?",
        "What caused the collapse of the Han Dynasty in 220 CE, and how did the subsequent Three Kingdoms period (220-280 CE) become the most romanticized era in Chinese literature and culture?",
        "Why do Chinese people still call themselves 'Han people' (Han ren) and Chinese characters 'Han characters' (Han zi) — what does this persistence reveal about the dynasty's foundational role in Chinese civilization?"

        "How did the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) create what many historians consider the most cosmopolitan civilization in the world — with Chang'an (population one million) hosting merchants, monks, and diplomats from Persia, India, Japan, and the Byzantine Empire?",
        "What technological innovations did Song Dynasty China (960-1279) achieve — movable type printing, gunpowder weapons, magnetic compass navigation, paper money — and why did these inventions transform the world only after they reached Europe centuries later?",
        "How did the imperial examination system evolve from the Han through the Tang and Song into the most sophisticated meritocratic civil service in the pre-modern world — and what were its blind spots?",
        "Why did foot-binding begin during the Song Dynasty, and how did this practice — which crippled an estimated 2 billion women over a thousand years — become both a symbol of female subjugation and a marker of social status?",
        "What was the Song Dynasty's 'economic revolution' — with urbanization rates exceeding 20%, iron production rivaling 18th-century Britain, and a merchant class that challenged Confucian social hierarchies?",
        "How did the Mongol conquest of the Song Dynasty (completed 1279) end China's most innovative era, and why did the subsequent Yuan Dynasty under Kublai Khan produce both cultural fusion and Chinese resentment of foreign rule?"

        "How did the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) — founded by a peasant rebel who expelled the Mongols — restore Chinese rule and create the iconic Great Wall, Forbidden City, and porcelain trade that define China in the Western imagination?",
        "What were the voyages of Zheng He (1405-1433) — seven expeditions with fleets of up to 300 ships and 27,000 men reaching Africa — and why did China abruptly abandon maritime exploration, one of history's most consequential decisions?",
        "How did the Ming 'sea ban' policy (haijin) of the 1430s — prohibiting private maritime trade and dismantling the treasure fleet — represent a deliberate turn inward that ceded the world's oceans to European powers?",
        "What was the role of the eunuchs in Ming court politics — how did castrated palace servants accumulate enough power to control emperors, command armies, and run intelligence networks?",
        "How did the arrival of Portuguese traders at Macau (1557) and Jesuit missionaries like Matteo Ricci (1583) begin China's encounter with European science, religion, and commercial ambitions?",
        "Why did the Ming Dynasty collapse in 1644 — what combination of fiscal crisis, famine, peasant rebellion (Li Zicheng), and Manchu invasion destroyed a dynasty that had lasted 276 years?"

        "What was the 'High Qing' under the Kangxi (r. 1661-1722), Yongzheng (r. 1722-1735), and Qianlong (r. 1735-1796) emperors — a period when China's population doubled to 300 million, territory expanded to include Tibet and Xinjiang, and the economy produced an estimated one-third of global GDP?",
        "How did the Qing's 'queue order' — forcing all Chinese men to shave their foreheads and wear the Manchu braid on pain of death — become both a symbol of conquest and, paradoxically, a symbol of Chinese identity that revolutionaries later cut off?",
        "What was the Canton System (1757-1842), which restricted all European trade to a single port and a handful of licensed merchants, and why did this system's rigidity ultimately provoke the Opium Wars?",
        "How did the Qing Dynasty's demographic explosion — from 150 million in 1700 to 430 million by 1850 — strain resources, fuel land hunger, and create the conditions for the massive rebellions that nearly destroyed the empire?",
        "Why do Chinese historians view the Qing's final century (1840-1912) as the 'Century of Humiliation' — a period of unequal treaties, foreign concessions, and national degradation that still shapes Chinese foreign policy?"

        "How did Britain's addiction to Chinese tea — consuming 30 million pounds annually by 1830 — create a trade imbalance that the British East India Company 'solved' by smuggling Indian opium into China?",
        "What happened when Commissioner Lin Zexu destroyed 1,400 tons of British opium in Canton in 1839, and why did Britain respond with a war (1839-1842) that forced China to cede Hong Kong and open five treaty ports?",
        "How did the Treaty of Nanking (1842) and subsequent 'unequal treaties' strip China of tariff autonomy, grant foreigners extraterritorial legal immunity, and establish the foreign concessions that turned Shanghai into a semi-colonial city?",
        "What was the Second Opium War (1856-1860), and how did the Anglo-French destruction and looting of the Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan) — one of the world's architectural wonders — become a symbol of Western barbarism in Chinese memory?",
        "How did the Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864) — led by Hong Xiuquan, who claimed to be Jesus Christ's younger brother — kill an estimated 20-30 million people, making it the deadliest civil war in human history?",
        "Why did the 'Self-Strengthening Movement' (1861-1895) — China's attempt to adopt Western military technology while preserving Confucian values — fail to prevent further defeats, including the humiliating loss to Japan in 1895?"

        "How did Sun Yat-sen's 'Three Principles of the People' (nationalism, democracy, livelihood) provide the ideological framework for the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 that ended 2,000 years of imperial rule?",

        "What was the May Fourth Movement of 1919, how did Chinese outrage over the Versailles Treaty's transfer of German concessions in Shandong to Japan — rather than returning them to China — radicalize an entire generation?",
        "How did the Chinese Communist Party, founded in 1921 by 13 delegates including Mao Zedong, grow from a tiny Marxist study group into a mass movement — and what role did Soviet advisors play in its early development?",
        "What was the Shanghai Massacre of April 12, 1927, when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists killed thousands of Communists and unionists in a single day — beginning a civil war that would last (with interruptions) until 1949?"

        "What was the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), and how did Japan's brutal occupation — including the Nanjing Massacre, Unit 731's biological experiments, and the 'Three Alls' policy (kill all, burn all, loot all) — kill an estimated 15-20 million Chinese?",
        "How did the Chinese Civil War resume after Japan's defeat, and why did Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists — despite superior numbers, American support, and control of China's cities — lose to Mao's Communists by October 1949?",
        "What mistakes did Chiang Kai-shek make — hyperinflation, corruption, alienation of the peasantry, military overextension — that turned a winning position in 1946 into complete defeat by 1949?",
