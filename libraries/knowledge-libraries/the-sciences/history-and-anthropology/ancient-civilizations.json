        "Why did the world's first cities emerge in the floodplain between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers around 3500 BCE, and what specific agricultural innovations made urban populations possible?",
        "How did the Sumerian invention of cuneiform writing around 3200 BCE transform human civilization — and why was its original purpose accounting, not literature?",
        "What was the Code of Hammurabi (c. 1754 BCE), and how did its 282 laws reveal a society obsessed with property rights, class distinctions, and brutal punishments?",
        "How did the ziggurats of Ur and Babylon function as both religious centers and political statements — and what happened to the priests who controlled them?",
        "Why did Mesopotamian city-states like Ur, Uruk, and Lagash spend centuries fighting each other for control of irrigation canals, and what does this reveal about water as the original strategic resource?",
        "How did the Epic of Gilgamesh — written around 2100 BCE — address death, friendship, and the search for meaning in ways that still resonate 4,000 years later?"

        "How did the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro achieve a level of urban planning — grid streets, standardized brick sizes, covered drainage systems — that European cities wouldn't match for 4,000 years?",
        "What does the absence of palaces, temples, and monumental art in Indus Valley cities suggest about a civilization that may have been governed without kings or organized religion?",
        "Why has the Indus script — found on over 4,000 artifacts — resisted all attempts at decipherment, and what would cracking it reveal about this civilization's language, trade, and beliefs?",
        "How did the Indus Valley's trade networks reach Mesopotamia, Central Asia, and the Persian Gulf, and what specific goods (carnelian beads, weights, cotton textiles) traveled these routes?",
        "What caused the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization around 1900 BCE — was it climate change, river shifts, earthquakes, or invasion — and why does the answer matter for understanding civilizational fragility?"

        "What was the 'Mandate of Heaven' doctrine, and how did it function as both a legitimizing force for ruling dynasties and a revolutionary justification for overthrowing corrupt ones?",

        "How did Qin Shi Huang unify China in 221 BCE, standardize weights, measures, currency, and writing — and why did he also burn books and bury 460 scholars alive?",
        "What engineering achievement does the Great Wall represent across its 2,000-year construction history, and why do historians now argue it failed at its primary purpose of keeping out northern invaders?",
        "How did ancient Chinese innovations — paper, the compass, gunpowder, printing — reach the West centuries later, and why didn't China itself industrialize first?"
