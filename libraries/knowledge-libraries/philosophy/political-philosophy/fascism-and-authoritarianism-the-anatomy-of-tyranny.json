      "name": "The Origins of Fascism: Sorel, Mussolini, and the Crisis of Liberalism",
      "topics": [
        "How did Georges Sorel's 'Reflections on Violence' (1908) — arguing that myths and violence are the engines of history, that parliamentary democracy is corrupt and exhausted, that only a 'general strike' or equivalent cataclysm can regenerate society — provide the intellectual raw material for fascism?",
        "What was Mussolini's journey from socialist editor to fascist dictator — expelled from the Italian Socialist Party in 1914 for supporting World War I, founding the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento in 1919, marching on Rome in 1922 — and how did he synthesize left-wing radicalism with right-wing nationalism?",
        "What made fascism new — not traditional conservatism (it despised the old order) nor socialism (it destroyed the labor movement) but a 'third way' combining mass mobilization, nationalist mythology, corporatist economics, and leader worship into something the 19th century had never seen?",
        "How did the crisis of liberal democracy after World War I — economic collapse, social dislocation, humiliated nationalism, the perceived failure of parliamentary politics to solve anything — create the conditions in which millions of Europeans chose fascism willingly?",
        "What was Giovanni Gentile's 'actualism' — the philosophical framework Mussolini adopted, arguing that the state is the supreme ethical reality, that individual identity is realized only through total identification with the nation — and does fascism have a coherent philosophy or only a coherent emotional appeal?"

      "name": "Nazi Germany: Ideology, Machinery, and the Holocaust",
      "topics": [
        "How did Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' (1925) lay out the Nazi program — racial hierarchy, Lebensraum (living space in the East), the 'stab in the back' myth, the conspiracy of 'international Jewry' — and why did so many Germans who read it still claim they didn't know what was coming?",
        "What was the Nazi synthesis — combining anti-Semitism (centuries old), Social Darwinism (survival of the fittest races), eugenics (breeding a master race), romantic nationalism (blood and soil), and modern technology (propaganda, bureaucracy, industrialized killing) into history's most destructive ideology?",
        "How did the Holocaust happen step by step — from the Nuremberg Laws (1935) to Kristallnacht (1938) to the ghettos to the Einsatzgruppen to the Wannsee Conference (1942) to the gas chambers — and what did each escalation reveal about how ordinary institutions and ordinary people become complicit in genocide?",
        "What was the role of propaganda — Goebbels's total control of German media, Leni Riefenstahl's 'Triumph of the Will,' the aestheticization of politics, the transformation of a nation of Beethoven and Goethe into willing participants in mass murder — and can propaganda alone explain collaboration?",
        "How did ordinary Germans participate — Daniel Goldhagen's 'willing executioners' thesis versus Christopher Browning's 'ordinary men,' the debate over whether Germans were uniquely anti-Semitic or responded to universal pressures of conformity, obedience, and opportunity?"

      "topics": [
        "How did Franco's Spain (1939-1975) differ from Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy — a military dictatorship allied with the Catholic Church rather than a mass movement, conservative rather than revolutionary, surviving because it avoided World War II — and was it fascist or merely authoritarian?",
        "What was Japanese militarism — the kokutai (national body) ideology, emperor worship, bushido code, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere — and how did it share fascism's features (ultranationalism, militarism, racial hierarchy) while emerging from a completely different cultural tradition?",
        "How did Latin American authoritarianism — Perón's Argentina, Pinochet's Chile, Brazil's military junta — borrow fascist elements (corporatism, nationalism, strongman rule) while serving US Cold War interests, and what does 'fascism' mean when it's backed by Washington?",
        "What was the relationship between fascism and colonialism — Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia (1935), Japan's conquest of Manchuria (1931), the argument that fascism applied to Europe the same violence that Europeans had long applied to colonies?",
        "How do scholars distinguish between fascism (revolutionary ultranationalism with mass mobilization), authoritarianism (rule by strongman or military without ideological program), and totalitarianism (total control of society including private thought) — and do these categories hold up?"

      "name": "Hannah Arendt and the Theory of Totalitarianism",
      "topics": [
        "How did Hannah Arendt's 'The Origins of Totalitarianism' (1951) argue that totalitarianism was something genuinely new — not just dictatorship but the attempt to reorganize human nature itself, to make people superfluous, to destroy the capacity for independent thought and action?",
        "What did Arendt mean by 'the banality of evil' — her observation at the Eichmann trial (1961) that the architect of the Holocaust was not a monster but a bureaucrat who 'never realized what he was doing' — and why did this phrase provoke fury from both left and right?",
        "How did Arendt's analysis of 'atomization' — the destruction of all social bonds (parties, unions, churches, families) leaving isolated individuals susceptible to totalitarian movements that promise meaning through collective action — explain why loneliness is a political problem?",
        "What was Arendt's concept of 'the right to have rights' — that stateless people (refugees, the denaturalized) are not just deprived of specific rights but excluded from the political community that makes rights possible — and why is this analysis more relevant now than when she wrote it?",
        "How do other theorists of totalitarianism — Friedrich and Brzezinski's six-point model, Václav Havel's 'post-totalitarianism,' Timothy Snyder's 'On Tyranny' — extend or challenge Arendt's framework?"

      "topics": [
        "What is the 'developmental authoritarian' model — Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore, Park Chung-hee's South Korea, Deng Xiaoping's China — delivering rapid economic growth, industrialization, and rising living standards without political freedom — and does development eventually require democracy or disprove the need for it?",
        "How did Atatürk's Turkey (1923-1938) attempt authoritarian modernization — abolishing the caliphate, adopting the Latin alphabet, banning the fez, secularizing law — and why did this top-down Westernization produce a century of tension between secularists and Islamists?",
        "What is the 'China model' — one-party rule with market economics, technocratic governance, censorship and surveillance, lifting 800 million people from poverty — and does China's success refute the liberal assumption that economic development requires political freedom?",
        "How do resource-rich authoritarian states — Saudi Arabia, Russia, the Gulf monarchies — use oil wealth to buy loyalty, suppress dissent, and avoid the economic pressures that might otherwise force democratization, creating what political scientists call the 'resource curse'?",
        "Can authoritarian modernization last — do the contradictions eventually explode (the Soviet collapse), or can sophisticated surveillance technology, economic management, and nationalism sustain authoritarian rule indefinitely in ways that previous technologies could not?"

      "name": "The Psychology of Authoritarianism",
      "topics": [
        "What did Theodor Adorno's 'The Authoritarian Personality' (1950) discover — that prejudice, conformity, aggression toward outgroups, and submission to authority form a coherent personality type — and why did subsequent research both confirm and complicate his findings?",
        "How did Stanley Milgram's obedience experiments (1961) — 65% of ordinary Americans administered what they believed were lethal electric shocks when told to by an authority figure — demonstrate that authoritarianism is not a personality defect but a situational response available to almost everyone?",
        "What is Bob Altemeyer's 'right-wing authoritarianism' scale — measuring conventionalism, submission to authority, and aggression toward outgroups — and why do people who score high on this scale reliably support authoritarian leaders regardless of ideology or policy?",
        "How does Karen Stenner's 'The Authoritarian Dynamic' (2005) distinguish between authoritarianism (a predisposition activated by perceived threats to group unity) and conservatism (a preference for stability) — arguing that what activates the authoritarian reflex is not change itself but the perception of normative threat?",
        "What is the role of fear in authoritarian politics — threat perception (terrorism, immigration, cultural change) triggering support for strongman leaders who promise security in exchange for freedom — and can democratic societies reduce authoritarian attitudes by reducing fear?"

      "topics": [
        "How did Vladimir Putin build a 21st-century authoritarian state — controlling media, eliminating opposition (Navalny, Nemtsov, Politkovskaya), weaponizing corruption, invoking Russian nationalism and Orthodox Christianity — while maintaining the façade of elections and constitutional government?",
        "What is Xi Jinping's model — abolishing term limits, the social credit system, the surveillance state, 'wolf warrior diplomacy,' the suppression of Uyghurs and Hong Kong — and how does Chinese authoritarianism differ from Soviet-style communism or traditional dictatorship?",
        "How did Viktor Orbán's Hungary become the template for 'illiberal democracy' — capturing courts, defunding independent media, rewriting the constitution, scapegoating migrants, all while winning elections — and why do American and European conservatives openly admire his model?",
        "What tools do modern autocrats use that their predecessors lacked — social media manipulation, deepfakes, targeted surveillance, economic coercion, lawfare (using legal systems to punish opponents), election manipulation sophisticated enough to maintain plausible democratic legitimacy?",
        "How do authoritarian states cooperate — Russia-China alignment, Gulf state coordination, the 'authoritarian international' sharing surveillance technology, election interference techniques, and strategies for neutralizing Western sanctions and human rights pressure?"

        "How did Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt's 'How Democracies Die' (2018) argue that modern democracies rarely die through military coups but through elected leaders who gradually dismantle democratic institutions — and what are the warning signs (rejection of democratic rules, denial of opponents' legitimacy, toleration of political violence, willingness to curtail civil liberties)?",
        "What is 'democratic backsliding' — the gradual erosion of democratic norms and institutions in countries like Turkey, Poland, India, Brazil, and the United States — and why is this incremental process harder to resist than a sudden coup?",
        "How does economic inequality fuel authoritarianism — the argument that extreme inequality produces desperation, resentment, and willingness to embrace strongmen who promise to punish elites — and does reducing inequality reduce the authoritarian threat?",
        "What role does media play in both enabling and resisting authoritarianism — propaganda (state media, social media manipulation, Fox News) versus accountability journalism (investigative reporting, fact-checking, press freedom as democratic infrastructure)?",
        "Can authoritarianism be permanently defeated — or is it a permanent feature of human political life, always available when conditions produce enough fear, resentment, and institutional weakness — and what does this mean for the design of democratic institutions?"
