      "topics": [
        "How did Edmund Burke's 'Reflections on the Revolution in France' (1790) — written before the Terror proved him right — invent conservatism as a political philosophy by arguing that society is a partnership between the dead, the living, and the yet to be born?",
        "What did Burke mean by 'prejudice' as a virtue — that inherited customs, traditions, and instincts contain more accumulated wisdom than any individual's reason — and why did this turn Enlightenment rationalism on its head?",
        "Why did Burke support the American Revolution but oppose the French one — arguing that the Americans defended existing rights while the French destroyed everything to build utopia from abstract principles — and was this distinction coherent or self-serving?",
        "How did Burke's concept of 'the little platoons' — family, church, guild, locality — argue that society is built from the bottom up, not from the top down, and that destroying these intermediate institutions leaves individuals naked before state power?",
        "What was Thomas Paine's response to Burke — 'Rights of Man' (1791), arguing that every generation has the right to remake its government — and why does the Burke-Paine debate still define the fault line between conservatism and radicalism?"

      "topics": [
        "How did Klemens von Metternich — Austria's foreign minister from 1809 to 1848 — build a European order after Napoleon designed to suppress revolution, liberalism, and nationalism, and why did this 'Concert of Europe' hold for a generation before collapsing in 1848?",
        "What was 'One Nation' conservatism — Benjamin Disraeli's argument that the Tory party must unite rich and poor, that aristocrats have a duty to the working class, that reform from above prevents revolution from below — and how did this justify the Reform Act of 1867 and the Factory Acts?",
        "How did Otto von Bismarck invent the modern welfare state — old-age pensions, health insurance, accident insurance in the 1880s — not from compassion but to steal the socialists' appeal, and what does this reveal about conservatism's pragmatic relationship with government power?",
        "Why did Joseph de Maistre represent conservatism's darkest strand — arguing that authority requires mystery and terror, that the executioner is the foundation of social order, that the Pope must rule supreme — and how did his theocratic authoritarianism differ from Burke's gradualism?",
        "How did the 19th-century conservative defense of monarchy, hierarchy, and tradition gradually transform into a defense of capitalism, property, and markets — a shift that would have baffled Burke but defined 20th-century conservatism?"

      "name": "American Conservatism: From Hamilton to Buckley",
      "topics": [
        "How did Alexander Hamilton's vision — strong central government, national bank, commercial republic, distrust of popular democracy — create an American conservative tradition that differed fundamentally from European conservatism's defense of monarchy and aristocracy?",
        "What was the 'Southern Agrarian' tradition — the Vanderbilt intellectuals who published 'I'll Take My Stand' (1930), defending rural life, tradition, and regional identity against industrial modernity — and why did this movement's defense of 'Southern culture' always carry the stain of its defense of segregation?",
        "How did William F. Buckley Jr.'s 'National Review' (founded 1955) fuse three incompatible strands — free-market libertarianism, anti-communist hawkishness, and social traditionalism — into a single conservative movement, and why did this 'fusionism' hold together only as long as the Soviet threat lasted?",
        "What was Barry Goldwater's significance — his 1964 presidential campaign ('extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice'), his devastating loss to LBJ, yet his transformation of the Republican Party from Eisenhower moderation to ideological conservatism?",
        "How did the conservative movement build its intellectual infrastructure — think tanks (Heritage Foundation, American Enterprise Institute), media (talk radio, Fox News), legal networks (Federalist Society) — creating a parallel ecosystem that eventually captured the Republican Party and the courts?"

        "What did Michael Oakeshott mean by conservatism as a 'disposition' rather than an ideology — 'to prefer the familiar to the unknown, the tried to the untried, fact to mystery, the actual to the possible' — and why did this make him skeptical of both socialist planning and free-market ideology?",
        "How did Russell Kirk's 'The Conservative Mind' (1953) construct a conservative intellectual tradition from Burke through John Adams, Coleridge, Tocqueville, and T.S. Eliot — arguing that conservatism is rooted in 'the permanent things': order, justice, freedom, and the moral imagination?",
        "What was Roger Scruton's contribution to conservative philosophy — his defense of beauty, tradition, and belonging against the ugliness of modernist architecture, the rootlessness of globalization, and the destructive nihilism of the 1960s counterculture?",
        "How does conservative philosophy define freedom differently from liberalism — not the absence of constraint (Berlin's negative liberty) but the exercise of virtue within institutions (family, church, nation) that give life meaning and structure?",
        "Why do conservative intellectuals distrust ideology — arguing that Marxism, fascism, and even libertarianism are all rationalist projects that impose abstract blueprints on messy human reality — and is this anti-ideological stance itself an ideology?"

        "How did the Moral Majority (founded 1979 by Jerry Falwell) transform American conservatism — mobilizing white evangelical Protestants as a political force, opposing abortion, gay rights, and secular humanism — and why did this merger of religion and Republican politics reshape American elections for 40 years?",
        "What role has Catholic social teaching played in conservatism — from Pope Leo XIII's 'Rerum Novarum' (1891) defending workers' rights to the natural law tradition opposing abortion and same-sex marriage — and why does Catholicism sit uneasily with both left and right?",
        "How did the culture wars of the 1990s and 2000s — battles over abortion, school prayer, evolution, gay marriage, sex education — transform conservatism from a philosophy of limited government into a movement focused on moral and cultural issues?",
        "Why did Patrick Buchanan's 1992 Republican Convention speech — declaring a 'cultural war for the soul of America' — mark a turning point, making explicit that conservatism was no longer primarily about economics but about identity, tradition, and the meaning of American civilization?",
        "How has religious conservatism adapted to secularization — the 'Benedict Option' (Rod Dreher's argument that Christians should withdraw from a hostile culture), Christian nationalism (the claim that America is and should be a Christian nation), and the alliance between evangelicals and Donald Trump?"

      "topics": [
        "Who were the original neoconservatives — Irving Kristol, Norman Podhoretz, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Jeane Kirkpatrick — former liberals and socialists 'mugged by reality,' disillusioned with the 1960s counterculture and the failures of Great Society programs?",
        "How did neoconservatives develop a distinctive foreign policy — Leo Strauss's influence on the belief that liberal democracy must be actively defended and promoted, that American power is a force for good, that 'realism' (tolerating dictators for stability) is both immoral and ultimately destabilizing?",
        "What was the neoconservative case for the Iraq War (2003) — that removing Saddam Hussein would democratize the Middle East, that American military power could remake the region, that the 'unipolar moment' after the Cold War created both the opportunity and the obligation — and why did this catastrophically fail?",
        "How did the Iraq War discredit neoconservatism — 4,500 American dead, hundreds of thousands of Iraqi dead, no weapons of mass destruction, no democratic transformation — and why did neoconservatives refuse to accept responsibility for the disaster they authored?",
        "What happened to neoconservatism after Iraq — its influence waning as Republican voters embraced Trump's 'America First' isolationism, its leading figures (Bill Kristol, David Frum, Max Boot) becoming Never Trump exiles from the party they helped build?"

        "What was Reagan's achievement — fusing anti-government economics ('government is the problem'), Cold War hawkishness, and cultural traditionalism into a message of optimistic patriotism that won two landslides — and why did the 'Reagan coalition' define Republican politics for 30 years?",
        "How did the Tea Party movement (2009) signal that Republican voters wanted something more radical than establishment conservatism — opposing bailouts, immigration, and the 'Republican establishment' with an intensity that bewildered the party's leaders and prepared the ground for Trump?",
        "What does Trump represent — the abandonment of conservative principles (free trade, fiscal restraint, democratic norms, personal morality) in favor of populist nationalism, grievance politics, and authoritarian tendencies — and is Trumpism a new ideology or simply the will to power?",
        "Why have working-class voters moved from left to right across the Western world — from the American Rust Belt to Brexit Britain to Marine Le Pen's France — and does this realignment mean that conservatism's future is populist nationalism rather than limited-government philosophy?"

        "Why did Patrick Deneen's 'Why Liberalism Failed' (2018) argue that liberalism (which includes most conservatism) has succeeded too well — dissolving every tradition, community, and institution into individual choice — and that the solution is not less liberalism but a genuinely post-liberal politics?",
        "What is 'national conservatism' — the movement associated with Yoram Hazony, arguing for strong nation-states, cultural homogeneity, biblical morality, and skepticism of global institutions — and does it represent conservatism's future or a retreat into tribalism?",
        "How does conservatism address climate change — market-based solutions (carbon taxes, nuclear energy), skepticism about government regulation, tension between stewardship (a conservative value) and the fossil fuel industry (a conservative constituency)?",
        "What do younger conservatives want — some embracing 'common good constitutionalism' (Adrian Vermeule), others seeking a 'multiracial working-class conservatism' (Oren Cass), still others doubling down on libertarianism — and can these incompatible visions coexist in one movement?",
        "Is conservatism as Burke understood it — prudent, gradual, respectful of institutions and norms — dead, killed by the very movements that claimed its name, or does its core insight (that human societies are fragile and that radical change destroys more than it creates) remain permanently necessary?"
