      "name": "The Philosophical History of Animal Moral Status",
      "topics": [
        "Why did Aristotle place animals in a natural hierarchy below humans — arguing that nature makes nothing in vain and that animals exist to serve human purposes — and how did this teleological view dominate Western thought for two millennia?",
        "How did Descartes' mechanism go further than Aristotle — declaring animals literal machines (bête-machines) without consciousness, incapable of suffering — and how did this view license vivisection without anesthesia in 17th-century laboratories?",
        "Why was Bentham's question revolutionary — 'the question is not, can they reason? nor, can they talk? but, can they suffer?' (1789) — shifting the basis of moral consideration from rationality to sentience?",
        "How did Darwin's theory of evolution undermine the philosophical basis for human-animal separation — showing that differences between species are differences of degree, not kind — and why did Victorian society resist the moral implications of this insight?",
        "What did the great ape language experiments (Washoe, Koko, Kanzi) reveal about the cognitive capacities of non-human primates — tool use, deception, grief, cultural transmission — and why did these findings intensify the philosophical debate about moral status?"

      "name": "Singer's Utilitarian Case: Animal Liberation",
      "topics": [
        "How did Peter Singer's 'Animal Liberation' (1975) define speciesism — giving greater moral weight to the interests of one's own species for no reason other than species membership — and why did he argue this prejudice is as arbitrary as racism or sexism?",
        "Why did Singer argue that equal consideration of interests does not mean equal treatment — a dog has no interest in voting, but it does have an interest in not suffering — and how does this interest-based framework determine which human practices are morally permissible?",
        "How did Singer's argument against factory farming use utilitarian calculation — the trivial human interest in the taste of meat versus the intense suffering of billions of animals confined, mutilated, and slaughtered annually — and why did he call factory farming 'the greatest ethical blind spot of our time'?",
        "Why did Singer's position on animal experimentation provoke more controversy than his arguments about farming — because some experiments produce genuine medical benefits, forcing a direct utilitarian trade-off between human and animal suffering?",
        "How did Singer's utilitarian framework lead him to controversial conclusions about severely disabled humans — arguing that a healthy chimpanzee has stronger interests than a human in a permanent vegetative state — and why did disability rights advocates accuse him of reviving eugenics?"

      "name": "Regan's Rights-Based Argument: The Case for Animal Rights",
      "topics": [
        "How did Tom Regan's 'The Case for Animal Rights' (1983) differ from Singer — arguing that animals are not just sentient but 'subjects of a life' with inherent value, and that this value generates rights that cannot be overridden by utilitarian calculation?",
        "What did Regan mean by 'inherent value' — that animals, like humans, are owed respect as individuals, not mere receptacles of pleasure and pain — and why did he argue that Singer's utilitarian approach would still permit sacrificing animals if the aggregate benefit were large enough?",
        "How did Regan's abolitionist position — that all commercial animal agriculture, all animal experimentation, all hunting and trapping must end, with no exceptions — differ from the welfarist position (reduce suffering within existing systems)?",
        "What is the 'lifeboat' problem for animal rights — if a lifeboat can hold four humans or one human and a dog, and Regan says throw the dog overboard, does this undermine the claim that animals have equal inherent value?",
        "How did the tension between Singer (utilitarian) and Regan (rights-based) split the animal advocacy movement — some pursuing welfare reforms (larger cages, humane slaughter), others demanding abolition (no use of animals at all) — and which approach has achieved more for animals?"

      "name": "Factory Farming: The Scale of the Problem",
      "topics": [
        "How many animals does industrial agriculture kill annually — over 80 billion land animals and 1-2 trillion fish worldwide — and why does the sheer scale of this system make it, by any utilitarian measure, the largest source of suffering on Earth?",
        "What are the specific practices of factory farming that raise ethical objections — battery cages for hens (67 square inches per bird), gestation crates for sows (unable to turn around for four years), debeaking, tail docking, castration without anesthesia — and how did these become industry standard?",
        "How did the documentary 'Earthlings' (2005) and subsequent undercover investigations — filming inside slaughterhouses, documenting systematic abuse — change public attitudes, and why do 'ag-gag' laws in multiple US states criminalize the act of filming inside animal agriculture facilities?",
        "What are the environmental consequences of factory farming — responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the leading cause of deforestation, antibiotic resistance, water pollution, and zoonotic disease emergence (including likely origins of COVID-19) — and why do these consequences strengthen the ethical case beyond animal welfare alone?",
        "How has the rise of plant-based and cultivated meat — Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, lab-grown meat — offered a technological path to reducing animal suffering, and can innovation succeed where ethical arguments have not?"

      "name": "Animal Experimentation: The Hardest Cases",
      "topics": [
        "How does the 3Rs framework — Replace (use alternatives where possible), Reduce (minimize animal numbers), Refine (minimize suffering) — attempt to regulate animal experimentation, and why do abolitionists argue that reform within the system legitimizes it?",
        "What did the Silver Spring monkeys case (1981) — Alex Pacheco's undercover investigation of Edward Taub's deafferentation experiments on macaques — accomplish as the first animal cruelty case to reach the US Supreme Court and the founding moment of PETA?",
        "How do cosmetics testing bans — adopted by the EU (2013), India (2014), and other countries — demonstrate that some animal experiments can be eliminated entirely, and why has the pharmaceutical industry resisted similar bans for drug testing?",
        "What is the 'moral schizophrenia' of animal research — scientists who genuinely care about their animal subjects while performing procedures that cause severe suffering, citing the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval — and how do researchers reconcile this contradiction?",
        "Why did the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness (2012) — signed by prominent neuroscientists, stating that non-human animals possess the neurological substrates of conscious experience — strengthen the philosophical case against animal experimentation while changing almost nothing in practice?"

      "name": "The Cognitive Revolution in Animal Science",
      "topics": [
        "How did Frans de Waal's research on chimpanzee empathy, consolation, and conflict resolution — documented in 'Chimpanzee Politics' (1982) and subsequent work — demolish the assumption that morality is uniquely human?",
        "What do corvid intelligence studies reveal — crows using tools, planning for the future, recognizing human faces, holding 'funerals' for dead companions — and why does avian intelligence, evolved independently from primate intelligence, challenge the assumption that complex cognition requires a primate brain?",
        "How did the discovery of octopus sentience — problem-solving, play, individual personality, apparent experience of pain — lead to the UK's Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act (2022) recognizing cephalopods and decapod crustaceans as sentient beings?",
        "What do elephant grief behaviors — standing vigil over dead companions, returning to burial sites, touching bones of deceased relatives — suggest about non-human emotional complexity, and why do these observations matter for questions of moral status?",
        "How has the accumulating evidence of animal cognition and emotion made the philosophical case for animal moral status stronger over the past 50 years — while the number of animals killed by humans has simultaneously increased — and what does this gap between knowledge and action reveal?"

      "topics": [
        "How did the Nonhuman Rights Project — founded by attorney Steven Wise — attempt to win legal personhood for chimpanzees, elephants, and dolphins through habeas corpus petitions, and why have US courts consistently rejected these claims?",
        "What precedent did the 2014 Argentine court decision set — recognizing Sandra the orangutan as a 'non-human person' with rights — and how did this ruling draw on the philosophical arguments of Singer and Regan?",
        "How does the granting of legal rights to rivers, forests, and ecosystems — New Zealand's Whanganui River, Ecuador's constitutional rights of nature, Bolivia's Law of Mother Earth — represent a different approach than individual animal rights?",
        "What are the practical consequences of legal personhood for animals — would pets be emancipated? would zoos close? would wildlife management change? — and why do critics argue that extending legal personhood dilutes its meaning?",
        "Why has the animal rights movement achieved more through consumer pressure and corporate policy (cage-free eggs, fur-free fashion, cruelty-free cosmetics) than through philosophical argument or legislation — and what does this reveal about the relationship between ethics, economics, and political change?"

      "topics": [
        "How do contractarian philosophers (Peter Carruthers, Roger Scruton) argue that animals cannot have rights because they cannot participate in the social contract — they cannot make promises, bear obligations, or reciprocate duties — and why do rights theorists consider this objection question-begging?",
        "What is the 'marginal cases' argument — that if cognitive capacity determines moral status, then severely disabled humans and infants have less moral status than some animals — and why does this reductio ad absurdum force defenders of human exceptionalism to find a non-cognitive basis for human rights?",
        "How do cultural and religious perspectives complicate the animal rights debate — Jain non-violence (ahimsa) extending to insects, Islamic and Jewish ritual slaughter (halal, kosher), Indigenous hunting traditions, Hindu cow veneration — and should animal ethics respect cultural practices that cause animal suffering?",
        "What did COVID-19 reveal about the relationship between animal exploitation and human health — wet markets, factory farms as breeding grounds for zoonotic disease, deforestation pushing wildlife into human contact — and did the pandemic strengthen the case for radically changing our relationship with animals?",
        "Why has the philosophical case for animal rights grown steadily stronger since Singer's 'Animal Liberation' in 1975 — while global meat consumption has doubled and the number of animals in factory farms has tripled — and what does this gap between ethical argument and human behavior reveal about the limits of philosophy?"
