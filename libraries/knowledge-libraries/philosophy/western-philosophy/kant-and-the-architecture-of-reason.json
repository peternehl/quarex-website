        "Who was Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) — born in Königsberg, East Prussia, never traveling more than 50 miles from home, so punctual that neighbors set their clocks by his 3:30 PM walk — and how did this provincial professor produce the most important philosophical work since Aristotle?",
        "Why did Kant say that David Hume 'awakened him from his dogmatic slumber' — specifically Hume's argument that causation cannot be proven through reason or experience — and why did this crisis demand an entirely new approach to philosophy?",
        "How did the 'pre-critical' Kant differ from the Kant of the three Critiques — his early work in physics and cosmology (the Kant-Laplace nebular hypothesis), his lectures on geography and anthropology — and what happened around 1770 that transformed his thinking?",
        "What was the intellectual context Kant inherited — Newton's physics seemed to prove that the universe obeys rational laws, while Hume's skepticism seemed to prove that reason cannot justify even causation — and why was reconciling these two positions the central task of the Enlightenment?",
        "Why did Kant take 11 years (1770-1781) to write the 'Critique of Pure Reason' — and then publish three Critiques, the 'Groundwork,' and 'Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone' in just 12 years — in one of the most concentrated bursts of philosophical genius in history?"

      "name": "The Copernican Revolution in Philosophy",
      "topics": [
        "What did Kant mean by his 'Copernican Revolution' — that instead of the mind conforming to objects (realism), objects conform to the mind's built-in categories — and why did this reversal claim to solve problems that had paralyzed philosophy for two centuries?",
        "How do the categories of understanding — causality, substance, unity, plurality, necessity — structure all possible experience, making science possible while also limiting knowledge to the realm of appearances (phenomena)?",
        "Why did Kant argue that space and time are not features of reality but forms of human intuition — that we cannot experience anything except in space and time, but we cannot know whether reality 'in itself' is spatial or temporal?",
        "What are synthetic a priori judgments — statements that are both informative about the world (synthetic) and knowable without experience (a priori), like '7+5=12' — and why did Kant consider their existence proof that both rationalism and empiricism were incomplete?",
        "How did Kant resolve the rationalist-empiricist debate — arguing that 'thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind' — synthesizing two centuries of argument into a framework that transcended both?"

      "topics": [
        "What did Kant mean by the distinction between phenomena (things as they appear to us) and noumena (things in themselves) — and why did he argue that human knowledge is necessarily limited to appearances, that reality 'behind' appearances is forever unknowable?",
        "Why can we not prove or disprove God's existence through pure reason — Kant's demolition of the ontological, cosmological, and teleological proofs — and why did he consider this limitation liberating rather than devastating?",
        "How did Kant handle the antinomies of pure reason — pairs of contradictory propositions that reason can prove equally well (the universe has a beginning / has no beginning; free will exists / determinism is true) — and what did these contradictions reveal about the limits of rational inquiry?",
        "What did Kant mean by 'I had to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith' — not defending religion against science but creating a protected space where morality, freedom, and God cannot be disproved by theoretical reason?",
        "Why did Kant's successors (Fichte, Schelling, Hegel) immediately violate his limits — claiming to know things in themselves through intellectual intuition, dialectical reason, or absolute idealism — and was this a correction or a regression?"

      "name": "The Categorical Imperative: Morality from Reason Alone",
      "topics": [
        "How did Kant derive morality from pure reason — without appealing to God, happiness, consequences, or human nature — in the 'Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals' (1785) and the 'Critique of Practical Reason' (1788)?",
        "What is the first formulation of the categorical imperative — 'act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law' — and how does universalizability alone determine whether an action is moral?",
        "What is the second formulation — 'treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end and never merely as a means' — and why has this become the philosophical foundation of human dignity and human rights?",
        "How does Kant distinguish between hypothetical imperatives ('if you want X, do Y') and categorical imperatives ('do Y, period') — and why does he believe that only categorical imperatives are genuinely moral, regardless of consequences?",
        "Why did Kant insist that moral worth requires acting from duty rather than inclination — that helping someone because you feel sorry for them has no moral value, only helping them because it's your duty — and is this the most admirable or the most inhuman demand in the history of ethics?"

      "topics": [
        "Why did Kant's contemporaries immediately attack the categorical imperative — Benjamin Constant's famous objection: must you tell the truth to a murderer asking where your friend is hiding? — and how did Kant's response ('yes, you must') damage his position?",
        "How did Hegel challenge Kant's formalism — arguing that the categorical imperative is 'empty' (it can generate any rule as long as it's universalizable) and that morality requires understanding concrete historical and social context, not abstract principles?",
        "Why did Schopenhauer call Kant's ethics 'disguised theology' — arguing that the categorical imperative secretly depends on God (Kant's 'postulates of practical reason': God, freedom, and immortality) — and was this criticism fair?",
        "How did feminist critics (Carol Gilligan, Virginia Held) challenge Kantian ethics — arguing that its emphasis on abstract duty and impartial rules ignores relationships, care, and the particular obligations we owe to specific people?",
        "Why did postcolonial critics (Charles Mills, Eze Emmanuel Chukwudi) expose Kant's racism — his explicit racial hierarchy placing white Europeans at the top, his defense of colonialism — and can Kantian universalism survive the revelation that its author denied it to most of humanity?"

      "topics": [
        "Why did Kant write a third Critique — the 'Critique of Judgment' (1790) — arguing that aesthetic experience and teleological judgment bridge the gap between the theoretical world of nature and the practical world of morality?",
        "What did Kant mean by 'disinterested pleasure' — that genuine aesthetic experience involves no desire to possess or use the beautiful object, that beauty is appreciated for its own sake — and why did this definition shape art criticism for 200 years?",
        "How did Kant distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime — the beautiful is bounded and harmonious; the sublime overwhelms us (vast mountains, infinite oceans, terrible storms) and reveals the superiority of reason over nature?",
        "What is Kant's concept of 'genius' — the natural talent that gives the rule to art, that cannot be taught or learned, that produces original works that become exemplary — and how did the Romantics (Schiller, the Schlegels) radicalize this concept?",
        "Why do contemporary aestheticians still grapple with Kant — debates about whether beauty is objective or subjective, whether art requires genius or skill, whether aesthetic experience is cognitive or emotional — all trace back to questions Kant formulated in 1790?"

        "How did Kant's political philosophy extend his moral framework — arguing that the categorical imperative demands republican government, international law, and cosmopolitan right — in 'Perpetual Peace' (1795) and 'The Metaphysics of Morals' (1797)?",
        "What did Kant's 'Perpetual Peace' propose — a federation of free republics, no standing armies, no interference in other states' internal affairs, universal hospitality for strangers — and how did this 1795 essay anticipate the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the European Union?",
        "Why did Kant argue that republican (representative) government promotes peace — because citizens who bear the costs of war are less likely to vote for it than monarchs who don't — and has the 'democratic peace theory' been confirmed or refuted by subsequent history?",
        "How did Kant's concept of cosmopolitan right — the right of every person to present themselves in foreign lands without being treated with hostility — anticipate modern debates about refugees, asylum seekers, and freedom of movement?",
        "Why did Kant simultaneously defend Enlightenment universalism and hold explicitly racist views — writing that Black Africans could be 'educated, but only as slaves' — and what does this contradiction reveal about the Enlightenment project itself?"

        "How did neo-Kantianism dominate late 19th-century philosophy — the Marburg School (Cohen, Natorp) and the Southwest School (Windelband, Rickert) — before being displaced by phenomenology and existentialism?",
        "How did John Rawls revive Kantian ethics in the 20th century — using the 'veil of ignorance' as a Kantian thought experiment, grounding justice in what rational agents would choose under conditions of fairness — making Kant the dominant influence on contemporary political philosophy?",
        "Why did Jürgen Habermas build 'discourse ethics' on Kantian foundations — arguing that the categorical imperative requires not solitary reasoning but actual dialogue among all affected parties — and how did this update address Hegel's criticism that Kant was too abstract?",
        "Why is Kant inescapable — every philosophical position since 1781 has been defined in relation to Kant (extending him, rejecting him, trying to surpass him) — and what does it mean that the most important philosopher of the modern era was a man who never left his hometown?"
