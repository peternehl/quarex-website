      "name": "The Young Hegel: Revolution, Religion, and Romanticism",
      "topics": [
        "Who was Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) — a theology student in Tübingen who watched the French Revolution with rapture, planted a liberty tree with Schelling and Hölderlin, and spent decades as an obscure teacher before becoming the most powerful philosopher in Germany?",
        "How did the French Revolution shape Hegel's philosophy — his conviction that history moves toward freedom, that revolutionary violence can serve rational ends, and that the Enlightenment's abstract ideals had to be 'realized' in concrete institutions?",
        "Why did Hegel reject Kant's limits on knowledge — arguing that Kant's distinction between phenomena and noumena was itself a form of knowledge about things-in-themselves, and that philosophy can and must think the absolute?",
        "How did German Romanticism (Schiller, the Schlegels, Hölderlin) influence Hegel's early thinking — the emphasis on organic wholeness, the critique of Enlightenment rationalism, the desire to overcome the fragmentation of modern life — before he moved beyond Romanticism?",
        "What was Hegel's relationship with Schelling — roommates at Tübingen, intellectual allies for a decade, then bitter enemies after Hegel mocked Schelling's 'Absolute' as 'the night in which all cows are black' in the Phenomenology?"

      "topics": [
        "What is the 'Phenomenology of Spirit' (1807) — a philosophical epic tracing consciousness from simple sense-perception through self-consciousness, reason, spirit, and religion to absolute knowledge — and why did Hegel call it 'the science of the experience of consciousness'?",
        "How does the master-slave dialectic work — two consciousnesses fight for recognition, the loser becomes the slave, but the slave achieves true self-consciousness through labor while the master becomes dependent — and why is this the most influential passage in Hegel?",
        "Why did Marx, Kojève, Fanon, Beauvoir, and Butler all find their projects in the master-slave dialectic — reading it as a theory of class struggle, colonialism, gender oppression, and identity formation — and how much of this was Hegel's intention?",
        "What did Hegel mean by 'the unhappy consciousness' — the divided self that cannot reconcile its finite existence with its infinite longing, exemplified by medieval Christianity — and why did he consider this a necessary stage that humanity must pass through?",
        "How did Hegel finish the Phenomenology the night before the Battle of Jena (October 1806) — Napoleon's army in the streets, Hegel calling Napoleon 'the world soul on horseback' — and why is this the most famous anecdote in the history of philosophy?"

      "name": "The Dialectical Method: How Ideas Develop",
      "topics": [
        "What is the dialectic — the process by which ideas develop through contradiction, a thesis generating its antithesis, the conflict resolved in a higher synthesis (Aufhebung) that preserves elements of both — and did Hegel actually use the terms 'thesis-antithesis-synthesis'?",
        "What did Hegel mean by Aufhebung — a German word meaning simultaneously 'to cancel,' 'to preserve,' and 'to lift up' — and why did he consider this untranslatable concept the key to understanding how contradictions drive development?",
        "How does the dialectic apply to history — each historical epoch embodies a principle that generates its own contradiction, driving history forward through conflict toward greater freedom and self-awareness — and is this a description of how history works or a prescription for how it should?",
        "Why did Hegel argue that 'the real is the rational and the rational is the real' — not that everything that exists is good, but that reality has a rational structure that philosophy can comprehend — and why did both conservatives (nothing needs changing) and radicals (the rational is not yet fully realized) claim this sentence?",
        "How does dialectical thinking differ from formal logic — formal logic says contradictions are errors to be eliminated; dialectical logic says contradictions are productive, that truth emerges from the collision of opposing ideas — and which approach better captures how knowledge actually develops?"

      "name": "The Philosophy of History: Freedom's March",
      "topics": [
        "How did Hegel understand world history — as 'the progress of the consciousness of freedom,' moving from ancient despotisms (one person free) through Greek and Roman republics (some free) to the modern constitutional state (all free)?",
        "What did Hegel mean by the 'cunning of reason' — that history uses individuals' selfish passions (Alexander's ambition, Napoleon's ego) to achieve rational ends they never intended — and how does this reconcile individual freedom with historical determinism?",
        "Why did Hegel place Europe (specifically Protestant Germanic nations) at the culmination of world history — dismissing Africa as 'no historical part of the world,' India as trapped in caste, China as static — and how did this Eurocentrism contaminate his entire philosophy of history?",
        "How did Francis Fukuyama use Hegel to argue that liberal democracy is 'the end of history' (1989) — the final form of human government, after which no fundamental ideological conflict is possible — and why did the subsequent 35 years (9/11, financial crisis, Trump, Xi, Putin) seem to refute him?",
        "What did Walter Benjamin mean by his counter-Hegelian claim that 'there is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism' — and why did he argue that Hegel's view of history as progress is told from the winners' perspective while ignoring the crushed?"

      "name": "The Philosophy of Right: State, Civil Society, and Freedom",
      "topics": [
        "How did Hegel's 'Philosophy of Right' (1820) argue that freedom is not the absence of constraint (liberal view) but the rational self-determination achieved through ethical institutions — family, civil society, and the state?",
        "Why did Hegel defend the modern state as 'the march of God in the world' — not any particular state but the rational state that embodies universal freedom through law — and how did critics (Marx, anarchists) accuse him of deifying the Prussian monarchy?",
        "How did Hegel distinguish between civil society (the realm of individual economic competition, what we now call 'the market') and the state (the ethical community that transcends individual interests) — and why did he predict that unregulated civil society would produce both enormous wealth and devastating poverty?",
        "What was Hegel's concept of 'ethical life' (Sittlichkeit) — the concrete moral world of family, community, and political institutions, as opposed to Kant's abstract moral rules — and why did he argue that morality without social context is empty?",
        "How did Hegel's political philosophy influence both left and right — Marx taking his dialectic and critique of civil society, conservative Hegelians defending the existing state as rational, British Idealists (T.H. Green, Bernard Bosanquet) building welfare-state liberalism on Hegelian foundations?"

      "name": "Marx's Inversion: From Idealism to Materialism",
      "topics": [
        "How did Karl Marx 'turn Hegel on his head' — keeping the dialectical method but replacing ideas with material conditions (economics, class struggle, modes of production) as the driver of history, transforming Hegelian idealism into historical materialism?",
        "What did Marx take from Hegel — the dialectic, the concept of alienation, the view of history as progressive, the master-slave analysis — and what did he reject: idealism, the primacy of consciousness, the worship of the state?",
        "How did the Young Hegelians (Feuerbach, Bauer, Strauss) bridge the gap between Hegel and Marx — using Hegel's own method to criticize religion (Feuerbach: 'God is a projection of human nature') and the state — before Marx went further and criticized Hegel himself?",
        "Why did Marx argue that Hegel's philosophy was ideological — that its claim to comprehend reality as rational justified existing power structures, that 'the philosophers have only interpreted the world; the point is to change it' (Eleventh Thesis on Feuerbach)?",
        "How did the failure of Marxist revolutions (the USSR, China, Cuba) reflect on the Hegelian-Marxist dialectic — did history not work the way either philosopher predicted, or did specific historical contingencies (backwardness, war, personality) derail a fundamentally sound analysis?"

      "topics": [
        "How did Alexandre Kojève's Paris seminars (1933-1939) — reading the Phenomenology as a drama of recognition, desire, and death — reshape 20th-century French philosophy, directly influencing Sartre, Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty, Lacan, and Bataille?",
        "How did the Frankfurt School (Adorno, Horkheimer, Marcuse) use Hegel against both capitalism and Soviet communism — developing 'critical theory' that applied the dialectic to mass culture, instrumental reason, and the administered society?",
        "Why did Adorno declare 'the whole is the false' — directly contradicting Hegel's 'the true is the whole' — arguing that after Auschwitz, any philosophy that claims to comprehend reality as rational is obscene?",
        "How did Judith Butler use Hegel's concept of recognition to develop her theory of gender performativity — arguing that identity is not fixed but constituted through social processes of mutual recognition — and why did this make Hegel surprisingly relevant to queer theory?",
        "Why do philosophers keep returning to Hegel — Žižek, Brandom, Pippin, Pinkard all producing major Hegel interpretations in the 21st century — and what makes this notoriously difficult thinker impossible to dismiss?"

      "topics": [
        "Why is Hegel famously difficult to read — sentences that run for pages, technical vocabulary that constantly shifts meaning, arguments that seem to contradict themselves — and is this difficulty essential to his method or merely bad writing?",
        "What did Schopenhauer mean by calling Hegel a 'charlatan' and a 'flat-headed, insipid, nauseating, illiterate' writer — and why did this invective fail to prevent Hegel from dominating 19th-century philosophy?",
        "How should a beginner approach Hegel — start with the 'Philosophy of History' (most accessible), move to the 'Philosophy of Right,' then attempt the 'Phenomenology' with a guide (Kojève, Pinkard, or Stern) — and why does every experienced philosopher say 'you won't understand Hegel the first time'?",
        "What did Hegel get wrong — his Eurocentrism, his dismissal of Africa and Asia, his ambiguous relationship with the Prussian state, his claim that philosophy arrives 'when the owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of dusk' (too late to change anything)?",
        "What did Hegel get right — that history is driven by contradictions, that freedom requires institutions, that consciousness is shaped by social recognition, that reality is a process rather than a collection of fixed things — and why are these insights more relevant now than when he wrote them?"
