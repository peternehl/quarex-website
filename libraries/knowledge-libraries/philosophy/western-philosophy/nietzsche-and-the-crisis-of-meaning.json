      "topics": [
        "Who was Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) — a classical philologist who became a professor at Basel at 24, resigned at 34 due to migraines and near-blindness, wandered Europe alone writing books nobody read, went insane at 44, and spent his last 11 years in catatonic silence?",
        "How did Nietzsche's friendship with Richard Wagner — whom he initially worshipped as the redeemer of German culture — end in bitter public rupture, and what did 'The Case of Wagner' (1888) reveal about Nietzsche's disillusionment with nationalism, anti-Semitism, and artistic decadence?",
        "What caused Nietzsche's collapse in Turin on January 3, 1889 — throwing his arms around a horse being beaten, then sending megalomaniac letters signed 'Dionysus' and 'The Crucified' — and was it syphilis, brain cancer, or a hereditary condition?",
        "Why did Nietzsche's books sell almost nothing during his lifetime — 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra' required him to pay for the printing, 'Beyond Good and Evil' sold 114 copies in its first year — and how did fame arrive only after his mind was gone?",
        "How did Nietzsche's writing style — aphoristic, poetic, deliberately provocative, refusing systematic argument — differ from every philosopher before him, and why did he consider this form essential to his content?"

      "name": "God Is Dead: The Diagnosis No One Wanted to Hear",
      "topics": [
        "What did Nietzsche mean by 'God is dead' — not a triumphant atheist declaration but a terrified diagnosis that European culture had lost its foundation of meaning, that the Christian moral framework was collapsing, and that 'we have killed him — you and I'?",
        "Why did Nietzsche present this announcement through the parable of the madman (The Gay Science, §125) — a man with a lantern in broad daylight, laughed at by atheists who don't understand the gravity of what they've done — and why was the madman's audience unable to comprehend his message?",
        "How did Nietzsche distinguish between passive nihilism (despair, paralysis, the 'last man' who seeks only comfort) and active nihilism (the willingness to destroy old values as a necessary step toward creating new ones)?",
        "What did Nietzsche think would replace God — not science (which cannot provide values), not secular humanism (which is disguised Christianity), not democracy (which is 'herd morality') — but what?",
        "Why did Nietzsche predict that the 20th century would be the most violent in history — 'there will be wars such as have never happened on earth' — and did the two World Wars, the Holocaust, and the Gulag confirm his diagnosis of nihilism unleashed?"

      "name": "Master and Slave Morality: The Genealogy of Values",
      "topics": [
        "How did Nietzsche's 'On the Genealogy of Morals' (1887) ask a question no philosopher had asked before — not 'what is good?' but 'where did our concept of good come from, and what purposes does it serve'?",
        "What is master morality — the values of the strong (nobility, excellence, self-assertion), calling themselves 'good' and the weak 'bad' — versus slave morality — the values of the weak (humility, pity, obedience), calling the strong 'evil' and themselves 'good'?",
        "How did Nietzsche argue that Christianity performed a 'slave revolt in morals' — inverting the aristocratic values of the ancient world, making weakness into virtue and strength into vice, the meek inheriting the earth — and why did he call this 'the most dangerous and uncanny form of the will to power'?",
        "What is ressentiment — the festering resentment of the weak toward the strong, expressed through moral judgment rather than direct action — and why did Nietzsche consider it the psychological engine of both Christian morality and modern democratic egalitarianism?",
        "How has Nietzsche's genealogical method been adopted — by Foucault (genealogy of punishment, sexuality, madness), by postcolonial theory (genealogy of racial categories), by feminist theory (genealogy of gender norms) — even by thinkers who reject his specific conclusions?"

    {
      "name": "The Will to Power: Beyond Survival",
      "topics": [
        "What did Nietzsche mean by the will to power — not a desire for political domination but the fundamental drive of all living things toward growth, self-overcoming, and creative expression — and how does this replace Schopenhauer's 'will to live' and Darwin's 'survival of the fittest'?",
        "How did Nietzsche distinguish his concept from social Darwinism — arguing that mere survival is contemptible, that the 'last man' who lives longest and most comfortably is the most despicable human type, and that the value of life is measured by what you create, not how long you last?",
        "Why did Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche distort 'The Will to Power' — editing his unpublished notebooks into a book he never authorized, associating his ideas with her husband's anti-Semitic colonialism in Paraguay — creating the myth of Nietzsche as a proto-Nazi?",
        "How did Nietzsche's actual views on anti-Semitism contradict the Nazi appropriation — he broke with Wagner partly over anti-Semitism, called anti-Semites 'failures,' praised Jewish culture — and why did the Nazis need to falsify his work to claim him?",
        "How does the will to power apply to knowledge itself — Nietzsche's perspectivism, the claim that all knowledge is interpretation from a particular perspective, that 'there are no facts, only interpretations' — and does this make truth impossible or merely more honest?"

      "name": "The Übermensch and Eternal Return",
      "topics": [
        "What did Nietzsche mean by the Übermensch (overman/superman) — not a racial superman but a human being who creates their own values after the death of God, who says yes to life including its suffering, who overcomes the 'human, all too human' — and why did he present this vision through the literary prophet Zarathustra?",
        "How does 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra' (1883-1885) function as Nietzsche's central work — a philosophical novel, a biblical parody, a Wagnerian opera in prose — and why did Nietzsche consider it the most important book ever written while the public ignored it completely?",
        "What is the eternal return — the thought experiment that you will live this exact life, with every joy and every suffering, infinite times — and why did Nietzsche consider the ability to embrace this idea ('amor fati') the ultimate test of a life well lived?",
        "How did Nietzsche distinguish between the 'last man' (seeking comfort, avoiding risk, 'we have invented happiness') and the Übermensch (embracing struggle, creating values, willing the eternal return) — and why is the last man a more terrifying prophecy than nihilism?",
        "Why has the Übermensch been misunderstood by everyone — Nazis reading it as racial supremacy, individualists as libertarian self-reliance, self-help gurus as 'be your best self' — and what did Nietzsche actually envision?"

      "name": "Nietzsche on Art, Truth, and Tragedy",
      "topics": [
        "How did Nietzsche's first book, 'The Birth of Tragedy' (1872), argue that Greek tragedy arose from the tension between the Apollonian (order, form, individuation) and the Dionysian (chaos, ecstasy, dissolution) — and why did professional classicists denounce it as unscholarly?",
        "Why did Nietzsche claim that 'we have art in order not to die of the truth' — that art provides the illusions necessary for life, that aesthetic creation is more fundamental than rational knowledge — and how did this inversion of Plato (who banished artists) define modernist aesthetics?",
        "How did Nietzsche's perspectivism challenge the notion of objective truth — arguing that every claim to truth reflects a particular perspective, interest, and will to power — and did he mean there is no truth at all, or that truth is always perspectival without being arbitrary?",
        "What did Nietzsche mean by calling himself a 'free spirit' — rejecting all authorities (God, state, tradition, science, morality) not from cynicism but from the desire to think without constraints — and why did he consider this the hardest form of intellectual courage?",
        "How did Nietzsche influence modernist art and literature — directly shaping Thomas Mann, Rilke, Yeats, D.H. Lawrence, André Gide, and the expressionists — and why did his writing blur the line between philosophy and literature in ways that troubled academics but inspired artists?"

      "name": "Nietzsche's Influence: Existentialism, Postmodernism, and Psychology",
      "topics": [
        "How did Nietzsche influence existentialism — Heidegger's lectures on Nietzsche (1936-1940), Sartre's concept of radical freedom, Camus's embrace of the absurd — and why did existentialists take his diagnosis of nihilism as their starting point?",
        "How did Foucault and Derrida draw on Nietzsche for postmodernism — Foucault's genealogical method (tracing how power produces 'truth'), Derrida's deconstruction (no text has a single stable meaning) — and would Nietzsche have recognized himself in these successors?",
        "Why did Freud acknowledge Nietzsche as a precursor — Nietzsche's analysis of unconscious drives, self-deception, sublimation, and the role of the body in thought all anticipating psychoanalytic theory — while Freud claimed he deliberately avoided reading Nietzsche?",
        "How has Nietzsche been used in contemporary psychology — the concept of sublimation in positive psychology, the will to meaning in Viktor Frankl's logotherapy, the emphasis on self-creation in humanistic psychology — and is 'self-help Nietzsche' a betrayal or an application of his ideas?",
        "Why is Nietzsche impossible to pin down politically — claimed by anarchists, libertarians, fascists, feminists, and postcolonial theorists — and what does this ideological promiscuity reveal about a thinker who deliberately refused to build a system?"

    {
      "name": "Nietzsche Today: Diagnosis or Cure?",
      "topics": [
        "Why does Nietzsche's diagnosis of nihilism resonate in the 21st century — social media meaninglessness, algorithmic conformity, the collapse of shared narratives, the rise of conspiracy thinking — and did he describe the future or create it?",
        "How does Jordan Peterson's use of Nietzsche — emphasizing personal responsibility, hierarchy, and meaning through suffering — differ from the academic reading of Nietzsche, and why do these competing interpretations attract completely different audiences?",
        "What would Nietzsche make of contemporary 'woke' culture — his critique of slave morality and ressentiment suggests hostility; his emphasis on overcoming convention and creating new values suggests sympathy — and why does he resist appropriation by any political tribe?",
        "How does Nietzsche's perspectivism speak to the 'post-truth' era — if there are no facts, only interpretations, does that license propaganda and conspiracy? — and why did Nietzsche distinguish between perspectives that enhance life and those that diminish it?",
        "Why did Nietzsche write 'I am not a man, I am dynamite' — and was he right that his ideas would reshape the world, or was this the grandiosity of a lonely, sick man who died before anyone listened?"
