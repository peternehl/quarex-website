      "name": "The Method of Doubt: Destroying Everything to Start Over",
      "topics": [
        "Why did René Descartes (1596-1650) — a French mathematician hiding in the Netherlands to escape censorship — decide that the only way to find certain knowledge was to doubt everything that could possibly be doubted?",
        "How did Descartes' dream of November 10, 1619 — three vivid dreams in a single night that he interpreted as a divine calling — convince him that he was destined to unify all knowledge through a single method?",
        "What did Descartes' method of radical doubt actually destroy — the reliability of the senses (optical illusions), the certainty of mathematics (an evil demon could be deceiving you), the existence of the external world — leaving what as the only thing that survives?",
        "How did 'cogito ergo sum' (I think, therefore I am) function not as a logical argument but as an act of discovery — the realization that the act of doubting proves the existence of a doubter — and why did Descartes consider this the foundation stone of all knowledge?",
        "Why did Descartes write the 'Meditations on First Philosophy' (1641) as a journey from total doubt to certain knowledge — structuring it as six days of private reflection — and how did this literary form shape the way philosophy would be written for centuries?"

      "name": "Mind and Body: The Problem Descartes Created",
      "topics": [
        "How did Descartes arrive at substance dualism — the claim that mind (res cogitans, thinking substance) and body (res extensa, extended substance) are fundamentally different kinds of stuff — and why did this seemingly intuitive distinction create a problem philosophy still cannot solve?",
        "Why is the mind-body interaction problem so devastating — if mind is immaterial and body is material, how can a thought (immaterial) cause your arm to move (material), and how can a pin in your finger (material) cause pain (immaterial)?",
        "How did Descartes' proposal that mind and body interact through the pineal gland — a tiny structure at the center of the brain — satisfy no one, and why did Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia's objection (how can something non-physical push something physical?) remain unanswered?",
        "What alternative solutions emerged — occasionalism (God coordinates mind and body), Spinoza's parallelism (mind and body are two aspects of one substance), Leibniz's pre-established harmony (synchronized clocks) — and why did none of them work?",
        "How does Descartes' mind-body split persist in modern life — the medical separation of mental and physical health, the 'ghost in the machine' concept of consciousness, the assumption that AI could be conscious if it processes information the right way — and is dualism an error or an insight we cannot escape?"

      "name": "The Rationalist Tradition: Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz",
      "topics": [
        "How did rationalism — the view that reason, not sensory experience, is the primary source of knowledge — unite Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz despite their radically different conclusions about God, nature, and freedom?",
        "Why did Spinoza (1632-1677) take Descartes' method to its logical extreme — concluding that there is only one substance (God or Nature), that mind and body are not separate, that free will is an illusion — and getting excommunicated from his synagogue for it?",
        "How did Leibniz (1646-1716) argue that reality consists of infinite 'monads' — simple, windowless substances reflecting the entire universe from their own perspective — and why did Voltaire mock this optimistic metaphysics in 'Candide'?",
        "What are innate ideas — Descartes' claim that certain concepts (God, infinity, mathematical truths) are born into the mind rather than learned from experience — and why did Locke's devastating critique of innate ideas launch the empiricist counter-revolution?",
        "Why did the rationalist-empiricist debate dominate philosophy for 150 years — until Kant claimed to have resolved it — and what was at stake beyond academic argument: the authority of reason versus the authority of experience in all areas of human life?"

      "name": "The Empiricist Response: Locke, Berkeley, Hume",
      "topics": [
        "How did John Locke's 'Essay Concerning Human Understanding' (1689) argue that the mind begins as a blank slate (tabula rasa) — that all knowledge comes from experience, that there are no innate ideas — directly contradicting Descartes?",
        "Why did George Berkeley (1685-1753) take empiricism to its absurd conclusion — arguing that material objects only exist when perceived ('to be is to be perceived'), that reality is ideas in the mind of God — and was this brilliant logic or insanity?",
        "How did David Hume (1711-1776) deliver the most devastating blow to both rationalism and empiricism — arguing that we cannot prove causation (we only see constant conjunction), that the self is a 'bundle of perceptions,' that reason is the 'slave of the passions'?",
        "What did Hume's 'Problem of Induction' prove — that no number of observed sunrises logically guarantees tomorrow's sunrise, that all scientific reasoning rests on an unjustifiable assumption — and why has this remained unsolved for 275 years?",
        "Why did Kant say that Hume 'awakened him from his dogmatic slumber' — forcing him to develop the Critical Philosophy that attempted to rescue knowledge from Hume's radical skepticism — and did Kant succeed or merely postpone the reckoning?"

      "topics": [
        "How did Descartes' vision of the universe as a machine — matter in motion governed by mathematical laws, no teleology, no final causes — provide the philosophical framework for the Scientific Revolution?",
        "Why did Descartes suppress 'Le Monde' (The World, 1633) — his comprehensive physics treatise — after learning that Galileo had been condemned by the Inquisition for defending heliocentrism, and how did this self-censorship shape the rest of his career?",
        "How did Descartes invent analytic geometry — the Cartesian coordinate system (x,y axes) that unified algebra and geometry — and why was this mathematical achievement arguably more important than his philosophy?",
        "Why did Descartes claim that animals are automata — machines without consciousness, incapable of suffering — and how did this philosophical position license vivisection without anesthesia and shape Western attitudes toward animal exploitation for centuries?",
        "How did Descartes' mechanistic worldview create the modern separation of science and values — if the universe is a machine, then questions of meaning, purpose, and morality fall outside science's domain — and has this separation been liberating or catastrophic?"

      "topics": [
        "How did Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia (1618-1680) pose the question that Descartes could not answer — 'how can the mind, being only a thinking substance, determine the body to perform voluntary actions?' — and why was her objection philosophically superior to anything his male critics produced?",
        "What was the Descartes-Elisabeth correspondence (1643-1649) — over 50 letters discussing mind-body interaction, emotions, ethics, and politics — and why did Descartes dedicate his 'Passions of the Soul' to her while scholars ignored her contribution for 300 years?",
        "How did Queen Christina of Sweden invite Descartes to Stockholm in 1649 — requiring him to give philosophy lessons at 5 AM in a freezing palace library — and did the cold kill him (pneumonia, February 1650) or was he poisoned by a Catholic priest?",
        "Why did Margaret Cavendish (1623-1673) reject Descartes' mechanism — arguing for a vitalist philosophy where all matter is self-moving and sentient — and why was she dismissed as 'Mad Madge' for ideas that contemporary philosophers now take seriously?",
        "How did the erasure of women from Cartesian philosophy — Elisabeth's objections ignored, Christina's patronage reduced to anecdote, Cavendish's alternative philosophy mocked — reflect a systematic pattern in the history of philosophy that feminist scholars have only recently begun to correct?"

      "topics": [
        "Why did Descartes need God — not for salvation but for epistemology, to guarantee that clear and distinct ideas are reliable, to bridge the gap between mind and world — and how did this make God load-bearing for the entire Cartesian system?",
        "How did Descartes' ontological argument work — that the idea of a perfect being requires that being's existence (perfection without existence would be imperfect) — and why did Kant's objection ('existence is not a predicate') demolish this proof?",
        "What is the Cartesian Circle — Descartes uses clear and distinct ideas to prove God exists, then uses God's existence to guarantee that clear and distinct ideas are reliable — and did Descartes recognize this circularity or was he genuinely blind to it?",
        "How did Descartes' critics (Gassendi, Hobbes, Arnauld) attack his proofs of God in the Objections and Replies — published alongside the Meditations — and why did Descartes respond with increasing irritation rather than better arguments?",
        "Why did later philosophers (Spinoza, Hume, Nietzsche) strip God from Cartesian philosophy — keeping the method of doubt and the focus on subjective experience while abandoning the divine guarantee — and what happens to Descartes' system when God is removed?"

      "topics": [
        "Why do philosophers say 'modern philosophy begins with Descartes' — the turn to the subject (starting from the individual mind rather than the world), the demand for certainty, the method of systematic doubt — and did this turn liberate philosophy or trap it inside the skull?",
        "How did Descartes' legacy split into two traditions — continental rationalism (Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel) and British empiricism (Locke, Berkeley, Hume) — that Kant attempted to reunify, creating a division that persists in the analytic/continental split today?",
        "Why did Gilbert Ryle call Descartes' mind-body dualism 'the ghost in the machine' (1949) — arguing that the entire framework is a 'category mistake' — and why has this criticism not prevented dualism from dominating popular thinking about consciousness?",
        "How does Descartes' thought experiment about the evil demon — a being powerful enough to deceive you about everything — reappear in modern philosophy of mind, in the simulation hypothesis, in 'The Matrix,' and in skepticism about AI-generated reality?",
        "What is Descartes' ultimate legacy — the insistence that philosophy must start from scratch rather than accepting authority, the privileging of individual reason over tradition, the demand that every belief justify itself — and why is this both the greatest strength and the most dangerous tendency of modern Western thought?"
